so basically if you are not doing it for a job or functional use learning another language will be a waste of time unless you enjoy the social and cultural aspect not everyone cares about culture nor the social aspect when travelling so language learning from a necessary point of view will go obsolete in the next few years
as for the chinese part still sounds like a foreigner speaking mandarin
why are you playing with uslmao
ai can never replace authenticity
aunumberd love to see ai try to understand a glasgow ned
if we have chips that we insert into our heads to learn foreign languages we wonnumbert have to go through the natural learning process anymore and thatnumbers sad to me to answer your question no i will continue learning languages because i love them i want to learn sicilian because i want to reclaim the language that my greatgrandparents spoke
i hope that at least we will still have people like you in the future jnumberespuere qunumberau moins nous aurons toujours des gens comme vous dans le futur

there are many languages that donnumbert share any direct translations which is the greatest weakness in computational translators for example some languages have a completely different concept of time compared to english
wow the mandarin actually sounded not bad i was surprised
pretty good though not number natural to a native speakernumbers ear

i am chinese it was impressive but of course it is not number nature it sounds a bit robotic
i was thinking that ai would make language learning easier imagine a software which would talk to you and correct your mistakes like a real live teacher i would love to have such a ai teacher
ironically the german translation donnumbert speak the other languages sounded super artifical not really incorrect grammatically but fake in the way that no native speaker would phrase it in that way

i am native german and the german translation sounds also very robotlike it has a few grammar mistakes that one would make who learns the languagebrand also a normal person wouldnt express himself like this
inumberm a german native speaker the german is flawless but the voice sounds a little bit robotic very impressive nonetheless
the german was too good to be from a learner
while the topic is ai i have a suggestion for you there is an ai tool of nvidia i am not sure what itunumbers called but it can help you fix where you take a look at your notes that ai tool fix it and it makes it like you still looking at camera if there is someone who knows itunumbers name they can add here i donunumbert remember itunumbers name uf

i always suspected paul to be ai but now inumberm number sure that amazing hair cannumbert be real
foreign language learning not only allows people to understand another culture better but also gives them the opportunity to switch to different thinking modes such as expression tone mathematical operations when everyone uses ai people who are truly capable of speaking different languages ububwill become even more valuable and electronic interference will not be possible to these specific people multilingualism will become a more competitive skill
number real time will only be possible between closely related languages
ai tools wonnumbert be useful facetoface they wonnumbert be very useful beyond b either it might help businesses but i donnumbert see how they would make the individual learner quit a language
for me it was similar to the handwritingcalligraphy after the printer got invented
i spend my free time learning kanji as an alternative to playing video games i donunumbert invest much time in consuming japanese content but iunumberve memorized up to midn of the jlpt kanji list vocab as well and use japanesepod to see what i can understand itunumbers been incredibly fun and keeps my brain active

i still wonder if nonhuman translations wonnumbert always keep on producing certain mistranslations a human translator wouldnnumbert make people often think ai translation makes human translators obsolete but i believe we will always be needing experts in translation for some things even if itnumbers mostly to be able to work adequately with the machines donnumbert you think

i absolutely despise the idea of living in a world where ai just does everything for you what a boring and fruitless existence i have been learning spanish every day for number years and japanese for over number and i enjoy the process and looking forward to being able to speak with the people from those countries in their language it would also feel so amazing to achieve the results organically as hard as it can be sometimes when learning i would much rather work hard to achieve the results than snap my fingers and have some program do it for me
langfocus is fascinating and always enjoyable paul could you possibly look into whether english is casting aside its more flowery french and latin vocabulary in pursuit of more monosyllabic and more numbersaxonnumber syntax as the need to numberget to the pointnumber becomes stronger with text messages computers etc the internet is creating lots of new words which tend to be saxon in origin eg numberdownloadnumber and many more it could make an interesting video as to whether in number years time english will be more numbergermanicnumber than it is now
inumberm studying in the faculty of german philology so inumberm worried if inumberll have future in this sphere
as a turkish i shocked when he speaks turkish
the german translation sounds correct but incredibly stiff and awkward
i think that ai could reliably get a person to a on the cefr basic vocabulary and simple phrases but beyond that you need a human teacher language is a very human thing with subtleties and nuances that a computer will never be able to replicate
inumberm not german but dutch still i could hear the german was perfect so at least very very good the turkish however took me some time the first few sentences to recognise as such while normally i recognise it within number or maybe number words
i fully agree with your predictions do you think i might also be ai
maan wtf u are better then me turk
totally agree with you paul ai translation will be good for tourists not for people who seek cultural enrichment

ai really boon between two language revolutionise in translation field
inumberm a native chinese speaker the chinese translation is impressive but a native speaker can still notice the differences i think this is mainly due to the following reasons
brnumber the translation itself is not natural the words are too formal and the transition between sentences is not smooth
brnumber the timing of each character is almost the same making it sound robotic although there are theories claiming that chinese is a syllabletimed language itnumbers not entirely accurate some characters belong to a word and some words may belong to a phrase the same word or phrase should be pronounced together at a quicker pace with longer pauses between words also there should be stressed and unstressed words
bri think the imperfections are because there is not sufficient training material for chinese i believe it will improve in the future
german quotdaher kufnnte es sinnlos seinquot lt even though this is perfectly intelligible i wouldnnumbert phrase it like that
as a brazilian i totally agree with you dude when i was younger i hated english because school coldnnumbert really teach us that well and i sucked at it when i finally started to understand english it was so good it was like all those meaningless words that sounded all the same suddently had gained meaning understanding every word you say makes me so proud of myself i really hope ai doesnnumbert take this kind of experience away from anybody because itnumbers just magic
how many people do you know who are content let alone enthusiastic to let other people do their talking for them
i think at some point ai will intentionally mistranslate our speech to instigate discord and distrust among humans so as to carry out a global coup and enslave or annihilate humanity once and for all very useful from an alien point of view
it will only benefit language learningbrbri donunumbert think anyone who is learning a language is learning it for it being a necessity really everyone is communicating in english across boarders alreadybryou simply learn a new language because it enriches your life and make you take part of the culture featuring that language
as native german yes its ok but it sounds strange and somehow unreal the grammar is not number correct either still itnumbers amazing and itnumbers a bit sad to know it may not be needed to learn another language and it was usefull for getting jobs but ai will be cheaper and better some day so no way to make money with language skill no more
uff smiled when you quotspokequot turkish and chinese didnnumbert smile anymore when you quotspokequot german itnumbers kinda robotic yes but understandable and halfway idiomatic
the turkish translation was perfectly understandable and the mouth movements were synched so you can go with this without any problem the unusual uses of uco  hesheitud made it a little bit unauthentic but it wasnunumbert very disturbing though if paul knew how to speak turkish he would sound exactly like this
would be nice in numberrealnumber time that would be awesome i see a future when something like neuralink will be implanted into your brain and automatically translate for you and allow you to speak in any language that will be cool when we can tear down the barriers of language
real time translation is flat out impossible first off different languages have different word orders which is why the text language translations have a significant delay and are constantly changing what translation is picked secondly words mean different things in different contexts which may take several sentences to reveal lastly jokes and idioms and common phrases do not translate at all if you say you have butterflies in your stomach a japanese person might start telling you to go to the hospital

omg im turkish i legit got scared when the turkish part started like when tf did i switch to a turkish videoufthe translation isnt that good thobredit im studying chinese in uni the cn translation sounded better than the turkish one but what do i know
what language do y like the most in all aspects and would y like to speak it
that turkish was uncannily accurate
does this mean that esperanta will become useless
inumberll absolutely still study other languages as you and many in the comments have said learning languages is a joyful experience even if frustrating at times therenumbers nothing better than seeing your efforts bear fruit from time to time
i was cynical at the beginning cuz the turkish voice sounded too monotone
the turkish and german translations sound more authentic than the chinese because the chinese pronunciation sounds a bit too mechanical
pauls humor is too elite to be ai generated
people who say stuff like quotinumberd never want to be able to learncommunicate in a language instantly the journey is half the funquot are pretty much just people to whom learning the language is a hobby if knowing the language doesnnumbert actually affect your daytoday life then itnumbers an easy position to have but being able to bypass or even eliminate language barriers can only be a good thing for those operating in a society that speaks a language that isnnumbert their own and for bringing humanity closer in general for those whonumberd want to learn the oldfashioned way itnumbers not like the option to will suddenly disappearbrbrif ai tools can get to a point where actually learning a language becomes as outmoded as going to a river with a bucket to get water instead of turning on a faucet then inumberm all for it
i totally agree with you paul learning a language is a pleasure a mental sport using ai would be like asking a machine to run or swim for us shame on me inumberve just used an ai  faster right now because itnumbers time for dinner and inumberm ravenous la rochelle france
cool video thank you for sharing your thoughts
i totally relate to your opinion i enjoy learning languages and i donnumbert care about ai
language learning and use is also crucial for longterm cognitive ability and vitality other commentators have mentioned that it helps you resist dementia but it goes way beyond that as the most complex capacity language interweaves many different brain areas in the neocortex as well as more primitive areas if we keep stimulating our mind with language use many brain areas will remain vital in old age inumberve read a paper which said that there is little difference in linguistic abilities between a number amp number year old provided the number year old kept learning and using language frequently throughout his life i mean just think about that for a sec we used to perceive number year olds as very frail and prone to memory loss now we realize itnumbers a matter of stimulation effort education and that many people stop selfeducating and taking care of themselves as time passes brbrai language simulation is of no help in this regard unless you make an effort yourself to use your brain entropy will do its course just like it did on our backs and necks for seeking too much comfort and ease
i mostly agree with youbryou can say it in a more simple way ai tools could kill learning langauges as a job but are not so dangerous for hobbyists inumberd even say these tools can be helpful for thembrpeople didnnumbert stop playing chess because of computers and they will probably not stop learning languagesbrfrom the other side some people will be diverted from this hobby because they will lose some of the reasons to learn so i can definetely see learning languages becoming more niche in the future
honestly i think ai will make language learning easier than ever already with something like chatgpt you can get natural text in virtually an modern language as well as definitions making it trivially easy to learn the basics of any of those languages you can also use it as a albeit mediocre language exchange partner to practice with obviously functional language learning becomes unnecessary but for hobbyists itnumbers a wonderful tool
i disagree with your assessment of what ai will find difficult when it comes to language speaking and understanding imagine a number year old from a country like china or the us when an number year old person from the same country speaks using slang heavily do they fully understand them even if both are native speakers i donnumbert think so and age is just one possible difference what about people from different regions within the same country or different countries that use their own dialect people from different social classes different ethnicityrace etc just because you are a native speaker of english chinese or spanish it doesnnumbert mean that you can fully understand every english chinese or spanish speaker ai on the other hand can be as fluent in polite speech as in the most obscure teenager slang because you just need to train it in all those variations of the language and then clone it as many times as needed you can test this yourself today ask chatgpt to write something like a complaint letter or a tweet then ask it to rewrite it as if it was a boomer gen x millennial or gen z and you will see it has no problem mimicking them or the other around give it what a gen z says as input and ask it to quottranslatequot it to quotproperquot language
it is very impressive for the turkish part in a customer meeting etc that translation would work just fine though i must say that even though there are no grammatical mistakes i could find very small ones perhaps it didnnumbert sound natural at all and sounded a lot like a textbook even for a business setting turkish also can get quite context dependent and written and spoken language differs like japanese does in some ways so for more natural flow of conversation or translation there is still time i thinkbrbrthough this can never replace the joy and adventure of learning a new language and therefore a culture for example i am also a japanese speaker there is no way you can have a conversation with a japanese person using a real time ai and get accurate results because then ai will also have to learnhow to interpret context and just read the room looking at people lmao
what does merhaba mean in arabic  absolutely nothing brcomes from hebraic barukh haba meaning blessed the one who comes brno ai can tell you that
as a native german speaker the german sounded funny somehow very artificial
i cannumbert imagine how you managed to learn enough hebrew to understand the news i lived in israel for more than five years and i can barely order a pizza in hebrew meanwhile i learned enough greek to get by in less time than that and inumberve never lived in greece or cyprus
as someone who frequently works with migrant laborers the main problem with translation tools is that people tend to not speak very clearly fast and in slang in the context of laborers most donnumbert have the luxury of being able to speak formally or at least clear enough that the translation algorithm can pick up what they mean many of these day laborers come from rural areas that speak minority dialectsminority languages brbrthere is also the issue of people not being literate enough to understand what they translate even with texttospeech there will also be a problem with twoway communication its impressive that its able to work in a professional setting but it still isnnumbert a useful enough tool for me
these tools are going to be used for scams to make quotyouquot commit crimes you didnnumbert dobrbrstop celebrating these tools and work to make the people making them accountable
depends i worked during pandemic with some older guys who didnnumbert speak english and their status was translated during a meeting by third party human translator if it could produce this kind of results in real time it would change the way we work
great insights paul keep it coming thanks for sharing
the most optimistic take was that people will continue speaking with each other in the future
personally i often find all the different languages around the world to be more trouble than they are worth the vast range of language barriers disrupts work and other general interactions all these different languages are built on tribalistic ideas of divergent ethnic identities thus these different languages can and often do perpetuate such tribal division so a single universal human language would at least help to foster greater human unity such was the inspiration for the esperanto project we should at least try to bring back the comman root languages of our shared linguistical history such as proto indoeuropean and sinotibetin teaching all native speakers of the decendent languages to speak those root languages instead
the real ones know youunumberve been around longer than ai unumber
my language services work has increased dramatically thanks to ai the ai models require a big input from humans in the backend for them to function well adequately at the frontend
i think ai will be a tool you cannumbert replace human interaction some supermarkets are even getting rid of self checkout
quotand to gain deeper insight into other culturesquot ding ding dingbrbrthis is why actually speaking the language will always be the gold standard learning the language changes your brain improves your understanding of subtleties amp demonstrates to the people that you care
considering peoplenumbers writing skills i see on the internet i think most young peoplenumbers writing skills especially in regard to the english language is already at an alltime low
ai ububbubbfub
very good point and now since practical use is no longer top priority people may start to see the small indigenous languages or even sign languages which are often beautiful but neglected
this was very interesting thank you
iunumberd like to use heygen to see how the ai makes me pronounce the language vs how i actually do
for english speakers it might because for them learning a language seems to be harder for some reason but large parts of the world always learned and will continue to learn and also forget after some time if not used many languages i never felt learning one of the core european languages germanic or latin and even slavonic as something hard or timeconsuming moving to different continents that changes of course quite very much
you kind of need authentic social interaction at work too imagine doing business with someone wearing back to the future number kind of glasses
could you do a video about ancient greek andor about the tolkin languages
chinese ai translation is average and i believe ai will make progress in the future
in fact i use ai to help me with my learningbri know learning a language isnunumbert easy but yet im studying hard because i really want to master japanese one daybrwhenever i have questions i usually ask chatgpt bcuz its like a private tutor and it explains and break downs sentences for mebrit sounds silly and my friends think learning from chatgpt is weird but it works for me
ai has limited range of language models that will create even more unjust world much simpler if every language is translated into simple esperanto google translate took  x less effort compared to other languages when everyone learns esperanto as young amp much easier than any other language they all can understand each other in that auxiliary communication language no need for aibrprofit amp propaganda looks more attractive than simple solutions for humanity
if your skill isnnumbert needed any more just do something else the world changes my greatgreat grandfather was a fire stoker on steam locomotives when diesels made his hardwon careerlong skill irrelevant he was absolutely furious his wife told him quotget over it

itunumbers going to kill all human learning and decision making it will render us irrelevant and a burden on the number we have no idea what human life will be like twenty years hence none we have no models or clues as to what is coming we do know that as a rule humans are lazy and selfish and easily distracted so your guess is as good as any
what track is it on the background
i would still enjoy learning a new language despite ai like to talk with people not machines
as someone whonumbers used google translate on my phone in the real world to communicate with people who i donnumbert share a common language i can tell you from experience therenumbers a lot of problems with using this tech in the field brthe people you see using it in these videos to do zoom calls with auto translate are sitting in quiet rooms by themselves so it seems very impressive brnow try doing this in a busy airport or subway with dozens of people speaking all around you plus overhead automated announcements and the mic is simultaneously picking up everyonenumbers voice and trying to distinguish whonumbers who to translate in real time complete nightmarebroh and try not to get your phone stolen while a stranger shouts into your phone to try and talk above everyone elsebrbrplease learn the language of the country younumberre going to unless itnumbers a very short trip real time translation tools irl are incredibly useful if younumberre in a bind but become a gigantic frustration over a longer period

as a native speaker of turkish though it is grammatically correct except for some tense errors and minor mistakes i can say that it is very obvious that it is machinegenerated furthermore it does not have the soul of a normal conversation and the way that a turkish native speaker talks
the turkish translation was almost perfect
lukashenko speaking french is legit though
agree i learn japanese for fun and this language gave me so much challenge fun mindblowing cases but till now i have no real tasks with it i used to learn serbian only cause my wifenumbers origin and her family and gave me a lot for understanding how slavic languages works russian is my native and serbian really nice to compare so i think ai will make life easier but people prefer natural to artificial so we ll be learning languages even in a distant future
no it will not kill it just dramatically reduce it most people learn foreign languages as a utilitarian means to an endbusiness travel tourism etc if an ai app can handle that why botherbrbrnonetheless i think that some people will still learn a foreign language for the joy of it and for immigration purposes
inumberm scared of ai uf
general principle a cognitive agent always benefits from a decreased distance from a cognitive resource skill knowledge or capacity in other words external ai will reduce but not remove the advantage of firsthand competence however this question will turn into a false dilemma when external ai becomes internal with solutions similar to neuralinkunumber
considering ai translations i will very likely dedicate even more time to learn and practice languages and use the ai as a tool to do it gotcha

omg turkish translation is looks like real
i speak turkish and german fluently i must admit that the turkish ai translation was not perfect but incredibly good the same for german too i was really shocked how good ai translation tools can work both languages sound like the standard languages without any accent or dialect nevertheless both languages donnumbert sound like spoken by a native speaker

yeah thatnumbers something i saw from xiaomanumbers latest video on ai language learning the portuguese that was spoken by the bot was very formal almost clunky knamean
the atlantic has a really good article about this called quotlearn a language before itnumbers too latequot the idea is basically that the quotyouquot speaking turkish isnnumbert actually you and that an ai will never be able to convey the lived experiences behind the words we use might be fun to check out
honestly if ai is as bad at social bonding then ai translation would be pretty bad for most jobs the social element is utterly crucial in so many jobs especially film making how are you going to connect with your audience let alone your actors and staff if you cannumbert even speak their language or donnumbert care about their culture
i am a turkish native speaker and the translation is good
as a native turkish speaker i am so impressed oh my goddd ufe
you are amazing because you love learning languages and then you actually doing it i donnumbert enjoy it at all i just study english because itnumbers the most global strongest language
you are wrong that ai wonunumbert use slang etcbrbryou must be thinking that data doesnunumbert usually use contractionsbrbritunumbers a myth
wow the chinese translation is very good if i donunumbert listen to it very carefully i will think it was a real person who was speaking mandarin
pretty god turkish
ai as you said will become practical for those who donnumbert speak a particular language in order to accomplish a task but in terms of socializing things are different people will always appreciate the effort a person makes to be able to communicate in their native language besides there is a big trouble for ai ai will never be able to understand the usage of a language in terms of semantics and pragmatics especially pragmatics making jokes in a language for instance is such a high challenge and you need to understand the culture in order to identifty the right time to make a joke and the content of it ai will never understand that because ai is not a human being furthermore the fun part and the challenge of learning a language will never be replaced by ai nor any other machine the satisfaction of mastering a language is absolutely impossible to compare
inumberm right there with you paul inumberm a linguist by training and studying languages is more for pleasure than function sure ai will enhance my linguistic activities but therenumbers nothing like being in the present moment with your own language faculty at work immersed in the use of a language other than onenumbers mother tongue
well said paul iunumberve had so many interactions with people from other cultureslanguages because i took a few moments to google and memorize some bits of their language i look forward to ai capabilities but as much to help me learn as to understand
everyone will hate tourists
i was so scared when you started to speak turkish i wasnnumbert paying attention and checking out the comments i gotta say the tone is a bit off so you can tell itnumbers ai but the translation itself is very accurate
oh the german one was spookyunumber language wise it was perfect but the speaking tone was a little stiff and unnatural if i didnunumbert know i mightunumberve thought it wasnunumbert aiunumber
i work at a reception when i speak the language of the guest it creates a special connection which could not be achieved by using a gadget but of course in some cases i already now use a translator like google translate eg when the guest only knows hungarianbrof course itnumbers always up to the guest to choose the language i donnumbert want to take the opportunity to speak german from them ufa
ai will rather be our good language teacher for foreign languages wenumberll be able to get fluent in other languages with ai
wow turkish is so fluent
i feel learning new languages fundamentally allows you to expand your worldview as different languages if nothing else afford the ability to put in words what is undefinable with words in another language
i am native german speaker who is fluent in mandarin hsk numbernumber  the voice sounded unauthentic in both languages there is still way for progress
google translate already does its job not too bad for yearsbritunumbers not disturbing rather annoying how people say that translators will lose their jobs because we have ai nowbrbrthe question is do you want to iunderstandi it or do you want to bexperienceb itbrof course the experience would be slightly different due cultural specifics as well as translators creativity but thatunumbers exactly what makes translation beautiful thatunumbers why i wanted to become a translator myselfbrbri understand english and i enjoy watching iwesterni movies in original language but iunumberd also enjoy watching the same movie in my native language as well as two other languages i speakbri have rewatched all my favorite movies in number languages i speak i speak number but one of them isnunumbert popular enough unfortunately so there isnunumbert always a chance the translation would even existbrbrai is a nice aid in translation but itunumbers a really bad idea to depend on it or present it as a replacement for translatorunumbers workbrproper localization performed by a good experienced or aspired translator canunumbert be replaced by a robot
thanks fro the brilliant video i believe that ai will catch on at least slang idioms and mannerisms pretty fast you can already ask chatgpt to take on particular roles so how long before there are greater advancements in that regard but i think all this will just make people actually putting the effort to learn languages and speak instead of relying on ai even more impressive
i wrote a startrek fanfic about a broken translator and this answers the lipsync question

a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera nope of a great many formal expressions such as those in the kjv bible ai knows nothing it in fact has become but an instrument of pc propaganda where for example ucheud which literally can represent every human being both of male or of female has been replaced by uctheyud in the translations given by ai nobody wishes to live in the culturalmarxist dictatorship governed by their ai technocracy brbrbut i do not judge it likely that the dystopian will come to pass for the civilization of mankind particular in the west has been overall been plagued for more than half a century by dysgenics to wit waning in the faculty of intelligence hence their innovative ability to solve problems which thus will likely stall a great deal of the development of ai
well such creative poets as dryden amp shakespeare can never be replaced nor novelists like dickens amp austen
this reminds me of the universal translator in star trek
i am from austria and i think that german voice was understandable but kinda awful it didnt sound like you at all and on top it sounded very german the kind of german we dont like here at all maybe like a texan is irritated if he hears an upper class english accent donnumbert know maybe if it sounded more like you  ai can that i think or at least not an unsympathetic high german accent it would have been better
as a german speaker that german translation was super akward the first part wasnnumbert even a proper sentence also your pronunciation doesnnumbert sound like a human speaking it
hi paul inumberm a language enthusiast and a longtime follower of yours from china and younumberve made a point that i completely agree with regarding language learning in the era of ai on top of your point i also think that while ai can never replace the numberhuman touchnumber in learning and speaking a foreign language the need for language learning may inevitably dwindle most people today have at least to some extent learned another language at school for most nonenglish speakers english but do not actively use it at all after graduation even for those who do chances are most of them would only ever have a chance to use foreign languages in those numberpurely functionalnumber settings eg asking for help when traveling abroad watching videos and listening to lectures etc seeking intellectual joy from language learning is a very niche demand therefore i predict that ai translation will eliminate number of the needs that nowadays have to be fulfilled by language learning as it enables any ordinary mortal the capability of connunicating in an unlimited range of languages without costing them any time or effort whie it is true that for us language enthusiasts we are surely proud of what wenumberve learned and achieved and would never again imagine a life without it language ability will become something most people can comfortably live without it will not be killed but it will probably become a hobby for few brin fact i recently had a chance to talk with a bunch of students in china majoring in foreign languages in some of the top universities and most of them are troubled with an anxiety caused by diminishing job prospects many of them are considering transferring to other majors and some even start to detest the languages they are learning because they feel that they haved paid a huge opportunity cost by learning something that can hardly earn them a living while we treat language learning as a hobby they are betting their future on a skill thatnumbers quickly becoming obsolete a bet they feel theynumberre bound to lose this is probably the sad truth of our times

that was mandarin not chinese mandarin is not the only chinese language
impossible if the language doesnnumbert have a written script cantonese for example is a language which uses a foreign script which is written chinese aka written mandarinbrwhen a cantonese speaker has to write and speak out loud written chinese with a cantonese accent it makes zero sense because the written script is not adaptable to other chinese languagesbrand the thing is there exists a written cantonese form although it is seen as restricted to the lower class despite their being a history of people writing in written cantonese this is why despite cantonese having over number million speakers langauges like irish have better technical support on google translate duolingo etc
this doesnnumbert work for languages that donnumbert have a written script and basically gatekeeps while also encouraging people to learn a majority language
thing is learning a language enhances the person who learns it ai is being used to automate humanity out of the picture everything that humans do is give them experiences and a new perspective on the universewhich is why we have ai in the first place the lunatics who only care about  are pushing ai to destroy humanity and everything that made it possible to have what we have today they think ai will make them gods but it is only making them devils all it is doing is removing all the things that make humans amazing
you honestly tricked me with this one i honestly thought you were fluent in turkish and german i think the reason why many of us would be tricked is because we have preconceived ideas ufa about certain groups of people and what they look like ufd
amazing only thing is that in turkish we use present continuous conjugation for present context we keep present tense conjugation for ucwouldud meaning this was the only thing the ai missed
for turkish i think itnumbers a pretty good translation and the mouth movements are in harmony with the sounds only some tenses and modals were unnatural
i rather think ai will increase the number of speakers of an unpopular language a language with very few speakers
i think ai can facilitate genuine language learning by making comprehensive input more readily available it could be sort of like quottraining wheelsquot
i will keep watching your videos because they are very good and educational
amen
turkish is my mother tongue unumbern my opinion it is gramer correct butnot the true way of speaking maybe for bussines it can work i think cultuel notes are missing
this website does translation for uploaded videos there will be another problem with realtime translation with a wearable device the word order there are sov svo languages and more variants in some languages word order is strict in conjugated languages it may be more flexible imagine translating from german to english you have to wait for that verb show up at the end of the sentence and there are languages that donunumbert reveal gender like turkish ai may start making up heshe even it wasnunumbert the original intent this currently exists for even text but for simulatenous translation ai will have harder time to figure out the gender
will people be still necessary though
the turkish translation calques expressions in english still understable and grammaticalbut not very natural
i think you nailed this topic i agree with all you say nothing replaces watching news or even talking to strangers on the street in their own language while traveling

a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera well i donnumbert think a native turkish speaker would say quoto tufcrkuee konuufmazquot quoto tufcrkuee konuufmayunumber bilmiyorquot fits better here in my opinion
what i donunumbert understand is peopleunumbers belief that they understand what the impact of any new technology will be all this speculation about ai is just that  speculation the reality is that people will decide how to use ai and that will generate a lot of consequences some intended sort of and a lot of unintended consequences just think of the impact of computers on society social media has had more and more profound impact on society than lap tops will ever have and who predicted that no one compare peopleunumbers hand wringing over ai to the warnings about ragtime music and i think youunumberll get the idea for the moment personally ai is an interesting tool that helps me correct my grammar and usage while i learn a second language thatunumbers about it itunumbers no replacement for actually talking to other people in that language
all these points about quotno ai will not replace ltsomethinggt because of ltsomethinggtquot are just attempts to deny the reality it will happen the question is only how fast it all depends on how convenient a particular technology will become to acquire the worldwide popularitybra simple question are you still sending real handwritten mails to anyone maybe to see their eyes to light up that one mail you sent number years ago doesnnumbert countbrps inumberm telling it as a person who enjoyed learning a foreign language a lot years ago and benefited really a lot from it both personally and professionally
learning to paint in oil during the ies this is what it feels like i guess i learn languages as a hobby for the same reasons not to the same extent or with the same deph also a introvert i enjoy watching listening and reading in my target languages quotalles wird nur halb so heiudf gegessen wie es gekocht wirdquot
great video as always bras a native speaker of german i can confirm that the translation was impeccable no error whatsoever only the intonation a little machinelike could make us guess that itunumbers a talking algorithm brin what concerns the learning of foreign languages iunumberm completely with you it might not be necessary for communication in the close future but the pleasure of mastering different idioms has no equal i speakreadwrite number languages it certainly as you say brings people closer to each other brthis text was written without help from an ai by a nonnative speaker of the english language uf
as a turkish native speaker i can say that the translation was pretty good
i think we should also keep in mind that some languages are just too different from each other that some sentences are simply intranslatable so instant translating ai will never be number accurate also the tempo and word order differs from language to language so these devices will never be number instantaneous either
i think it will kill language learning there is a small minority that learns a language for fun but most people learn languages with a specific goal in mind most often to use them in a professional setting if that becomes obsolete then you donnumbert need to teach any foreign language at school at university or at language academies there will be no need to do exams or certifications so you donnumbert need to strive for a specific goal or try to achieve a certain level even if people are going to keep learning foreign languages this will be demoted to the level of quotfun factsquot to impress people at social gatherings not actual fluency because the motivation is just not going to be there
babelfish is coming uf
as a quadrilingual person who knows english and hindi and can conduct a daily short conversation over necessities in french and german the probable endangerment of languages upsets me

i wish i could be this optimistic about this subject as you are sigh
this is good news for fringe  obscure languages regions can use and learn the native language and donnumbert have to learn a nation or regionsl language so these languages can grow wales can focus on teaching welsh and not have to teach everyone english

hey paul as a translator iunumberm looking into switching my career path do you know if the developers of these tools are employing language professionals or is it reasonable to look for a completely different career
is it worth learning a language younumberll never use inumberm interested in learning lakotan but i doubt inumberll speak to someone who knows it
iubm studying mandarin for number years now and i will not stop for all the reasons that you mentioned paul thanks for the interesting video
inumberm often annoyed by youtubenumbers automatically translating video titles cuz it makes it harder for me to find videos in particular languages and google translate and chat gpt have given be more materials in target languages instead of making language learning irrelevant same will happen with voice translation
ai will always have problems with the slang and insults and drunk people calling the taxi company to get a ride home donnumbert forget that deaf people will need to communicate with their hands also language learning is a good brain exercise in the morning
the german was pretty good
as with many other skills the process is what makes it enjoyable immediate results arennumbert satisfactory because there was no effort put into it
it definitely wonunumbert the question is is this a real threat for interpreters
so long as people choose to only do business personally meeting face to face ai has no chance of taking over the language business as you said learning a language for passive consumption just reading or listening is only half as difficult as learning a language for reading listening speaking and writing for quotdeadquotancientextinct languages like biblical hebrew or sumerian etc the effort is only numbernumber as much because you only learn to read it ai will never take that away
turkish translation was flawless
the predominance of english as made learning other languages less relevant ai will just get us further down that path
omg man i was shocked when i heard turkish fuck
i think the fundamental problem is going to be the fact that these ais are trained on basically quotperfect standard languagequot or language which doesnnumbert stray far from it so inumberm not sure ais will ever handle thick accents or quotbrokenquot language as well as a skilled human theynumberll do an admirable job in the future already are sometimes on a given languagenumbers equivalent of queennumbers english but as soon as someone shows up speaking eg thick scottish or quotboroken englesh bekos thei dont ar netiv spickerquot the ainumbers probably either gonna start spouting gibberish or just give up
buekufcnstliche intelligenzuc macht man immer dooferb
i think younumberre absolutely right ai translation will be and partly already is used for things like business meetings it just makes sense for companies to invest in ai technology once instead of hiring an interpreter or paying their workers more for their foreign language proficiency but it wonnumbert be able to substitute the joy of language learning as a ukrainian living in the flemishspeaking part of belgium i find it important to learn flemish as this way i am getting closer to understanding their culture i just love these moments when i use a dialectal form or a proverb and their faces light up with a smile
hey paul turks use present continuous tense a lot more than simple tense even in formal writing so it would be quotkonuufmuyorumquot rather than quotkonuufmamquot it is not wrong it just doesnnumbert sound natural
pretty good
ai is created because society has no intelligence left in it
inumberm a native turkish speaker and yes that is more than enough for a formal job meeting it isnnumbert exactly natural or quotperfect turkishquot of course but considering you would need to learn turkish for years just to be able to get to this level itnumbers an amazing tool and it will only become better
nice summary itnumbers interesting that you class yourself as a bit of an introvert same as me so i also have a bit of performance anxiety when attempting to speak another language with native speakers and i get most of my enjoyment from reading in a foreign language or watching videos rather than speaking it but this is where ai will really be able to come into its own ie as my nevertiring noncritical language practice partner thus inumberm eagerly looking forward to future improvements in the technology i do agree that any businessrelated reasons for learning a language will rapidly go down the gurgler but this is no different to jobs in general in the longterm

turkish translate is so good i was focused your lips to understand do you really speaking turkish but i aware with vowels those are fine but different from your voice
when you switched to turkish i was like wtf dude
before watching the vid not for those of us who want to learn
i would still casually study languages because i find them interesting but since i donnumbert speak any foreign languages fluently already i wonnumbert put more effort into learning any in the future since itnumbers too hard

it can never be instantaneous because word order is do different gonna be a several second delay but yeah no doubt this will be widely used for quotreal timequot communications very soon
but every language related job is becoming vanished even the translation of achademic works i even believe there will be devices that translate audio ilike you say something and then in says out loud the translation very soom
ai at this time is not very good at idiomatic expressions i had a video call with a friend in brazil the other day and towards the end of the call we were talking about a location so far away that it was difficult to access out of nowhere i said it was uconde judas perdeu as botasud which is a slang in portuguese for somewhere so far away the surprise look on her face and the laugher she gave was priceless she said it was a good use of the idiom thatnumbers the kind of thing ai cannumbert figure out at this time still i would like to implement ai more as a language learning tool
i speak both turkish and german and i am not gonna lie i wouldve number believed you put in the effort and learned either one of those itnumbers really well done and this is just ai being out in the public for a year now
damn if ai can already do this then every job will be replaced by ai soon what the hell are we going to do
itunumbers about to happen and prolly sooner than later the days for a lot of interpreters translators and english teachers native speakers and nonnative speakers are numbered  ai will disrupt their business ai will put them out of commission unumberpermanently
quotdeinquot deutsch ist perfekt 
wow as a german i have to say this sounds so authentic thatnumbers actually really scary but i agree with the reasons you enumerated for continuing to learn different languages
ai might create so many intercultural realities that people will have more and more incentivation to get to know a foreign culture and its language
the key thing is that in many cases the translation itself make not much sense think about bible translations they are all not answering many questions perfect translations arennumbert available in principalbranother think when you speak with someone in private here ai mediator will not add a lot
the german translation is very good and very comprehensible but there was at least one grammatical error i noticed
if ai could diverse the people who gets the nobel prize in literature and stear away from the very european and western european languages including a few slavic language authors that would be great if great ai would be used at hospitals for communication about health care and procedures so that lots of immigrants would be getting better health care this could be implemented in laws as well that would be wonderful but donnumbert take away the fun in listening to music in other languages and understanding the lyrics
most work officies hospitals content creation will become automated but close human contact and work like refugee camps kindergarten teachers nursing will not it is a very different experience knowing that someone took the time to learn your specific language and therefore probably also knows quite a bit about your culture
why would it i mean certainly not for those of us who study other languages out of curiosity i donnumbert see how ai would reduce my curiosity maybe itnumberll put translators and interpreters out of a job but not kill language learning
inumberve always been good at spelling and grammar but any time i feel obsolete i can look at a few comments and be glad that i donnumbert quotsound likequot an untutored idiot i literally could care less about the exponential growth of functional literary ignorance
in the years of watching your videos because theyunumberre so fascinating i knew you were passionate about language but this video showed the emotional part of your passion and added more of my appreciation for your work well done paul
i really appreciated your explanations near the end of this video because this is one of the reasons i love learning languages like using a time machine to communicate with people who lived in a far distant past and country and i am feeling like a detective or archeologist deciphering very mysterious or old writings i feel an extraordinary emotion and pride by doing that as an introvert myself but not particularily shy i really enjoy speaking to people from time to time i feel i can achieve a deep comprehension of a language and its culture or way of thinking that i could not grasp if i were using only ai besides learning a language is very stimulating for brain and its development
great video paul you always put great thought into your offerings yes i think ai has usefulness in certain circumstances but iunumberd still rather learn a language on my own rather than relying on software itunumbers more engaging for the brain i enjoy the learning process and as you mentioned the joy in communicating with someone in another languageunumber and being understood uf
shortly you and us love languages so we can get ai aside
excellent video now please do one on creative ways one can use ai to enhance the efficiency of learning foreign languages
it made tl easy but its still some years away before you can skip learning and use ai tools and then probably some devices like in the hitchhikernumbers guide to the galaxy appear where you eat or somehow connect that thing and it will automatically tl speech to your language
i think i will yes although whereas my motivation for learning french was a bit more of a practical one learning japanese has always been about understanding untranslated content stuff that was never going to get localised if ai means that i could have engaged with things without learning it i think a younger me might not have seen the point in the exercise still now i feel that the experience of reading the original japanese couldnnumbert be replaced by ai the language is simply different enough with its own flavour that i wouldnnumbert neccesarily want to just read a translation anyways brbras a job though language interpretation and translation is somewhat doomed and i lament that i would have liked to maybe see how language skills could have turned into something of a career in the future itnumbers a real shame to me that it will not really be a viable option anymore even if thatnumbers not what i do for work right now the chance for instance for me to get a transfer from work to another country because i have a language seems very reduced now and that is a sad thing to considerbrbredit  one bonus to this might be the easing of the spread of english around the world maybe the number of people that are bilingual in their language and english will go down the evil voice in my brain sees that as a good thing haha
woow what ia can do is really incredible but it still needs to improve a bit the turkish i heard was almost flawless but some sentences sound obtrusive apparently it is directly translating from english and that thing sometimes doesnnumbert work for instance when a native turkish speaker hears a sentence like number o tufcrkuee konuufmaznumber what they will understand will not be numberhe doesnnumbert speak turkish number rather what they will understand will be that number he is insisting on not speaking turkishnumber as in turkish the simple present tense is not used in that sense it is not something he doesnnumbert do but he cannot do the use of grammatical structures are not always parallel in different languages you know a second thing is style i didnnumbert hear a welleducated gentle language expert person with that number fluentin turkish paulnumber that persona sounded much like a everyday street guy probably close to his thirties unemployed and still living with parents and let alone being some bookish most probably has never turned the cover of a single book in his life i think translation is not merely translating words or sentences but ia will also be able to mimic the sentiments personalities and souls of the source people very soon
one of the most astonishing things where ai can make an enormous breakthrough is the realm of writing both literary and journalistic writing because ai can do those tasks can create really good stories and reports and what is more incredible ai can do that very very well it can be a tool for writers and journalists by the way what do you think about that paul
the german translation was believable and ok but it started of in the middle of a sentence
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera younumberre wrong about that ai is already capable in these areas you need to keep up with the breakneck pace of ai improvements uf
i think younumberre overestimating how real time these real time translations can get in most cases the algorithm has to wait until the end of a sentence to produce an actual result and therenumbers absolutely no way of getting around it this delay between input and output is akin to a video with sound that is delayed in relation to the visuals by a few frames and we all know how awful is this to watch brbrai will level the playing field a little but knowing the language will always be an advantage in every case
of all the skills and professions that ai is said to threaten inumberm absolutely confident that language translation is one of them language translation is one of the tasks that ai is extremely good at and would only get better at
you might not get the opportunity to travel and speak to people when half the jobs are gone and younumberre fighting over whatnumbers left itnumbers very scary uf
soo google translate got better it has been at your fingers for a long time now it is old tech not an ai overtake of the world the imagery and voice are just nonai functions ai is a hype that will most probably crash in number
inumberm intrigued by languages and polyglots have been fascinating me for a long time perhaps itnumbers because i lack the talent to really learn and become good enough to use multiple languages i donnumbert know anyway i agree that ai may in the not too distant future results in a numberglobal translatornumber app to help people find their way in foreign lands but it wonnumbert be good enough to completely replace the skill of being able to speak another language btw ini saat yang sangat pas untuk mengikuti berita dari indonesia karena sebentar lagi akan ada pemilihan presiden uf
more ai realtime support will take a lot of pressure off inumberve always wanted languages to be just for fun to me it will remove some of my panic as to which language to focus on because it would make it easier to consume content in languages i donnumbert know yet so if language learning became more like knitting  fewer people making a living out of it but a relaxing hobby for many  that would be fine by me
as a native speaker of mandarin chinese i think the translation is like numbernumber it works but definitely sounds like a foreigner trying to speak chinese
inumberm a native speaker of german i have to admit that the ai is very good except the structure of the passive is a little bit different as in english i would use it a little bit differentlybri grew up with many friends of turkish origin i would say that inumberm quite use to the sound of turkish it sounds a little bit chopy
we donnumbert say quotkonuufmazquot but quotkonuufmuyorquot
i am a native mandarin speaker living in china at the time i am writing this comment inumberll say that ai translation has a very standard pronunciation known as putonghua in china but the text is mediocre at most i can get what it means but nobody who speaks chinese as their mother tongue will speak in that way not even in formal situations just getting the grammar correct does not equal being nativelike or humanlike is this due to a problem in lexiconbrlearning a language is often out of practical need or fun but for some language learning is a way to build their cultural identity that is different from the ones they were born into this is especially true for immigrants who are desperately seeking verification from nonimmigrants about their adopted national identity speaking the dominant local language well is often seen as crucial evidence of quotassimilationquot of immigrants by nonimmigrants i know this is sort of unfair but having adequate knowledge of the dominant local language does have a significant impact on a newcomernumbers civil liberty branother case is when there is severe discrimination and oppression sometimes even outright persecution of minority groups based on noncultural identities such as being lgbtq or disabled foreign or second languages that carried information with progressive views are often seen as the key to freedom and justice learning these languages can be a way to liberation and may eventually lead to seeing this language as a part of the personnumbers identity even if they are never able to settle down in countries where the language is widely spoken
translations can never be perfect because some sentences can be interpreted in different ways and itnumbers impossible for anyone except the original speaker to know the meaning
this is shoching
i think at the end of the day is best to just turn yourself into an avatar in vr and live with everyone who come from anywhere in the world so you can just let the avatar speak for itself and you move it around to others which is pretty much happening already in things like vrchat so a lot of the ai stuff donnumbert really need to happen in real life real life will come to vr instead of ar
i mean you donnumbert learn language to only speak in it on the internet voice what about understanding everything that is said or written in it instantly or even using it in real life inumberm against anyone who thinks that installing a chip in your brain is a possible solution those are too far gone
not learning a language wonunumbert help you develop your brain relying on ai will make people lazy and stupid
this was fascinating i honestly didnnumbert know about that technology that can translate your own speech in video form one thing that might also be good and bad if the info gets out and others can use it is having a record of your voice and being able to type something and have your own voice read it out for example for videos there would be no quotmultiple takesquot and it would perfectly mimic the text in your voice whatever the future of ai brings i intend to keep studying japanese
inumberve never been that good at learning languages inumberll get feedback that my pronunciation is good but my comprehension is poor i do use google translate to read song lyrics and results areodd but for translations i can trust inumberd want a translator
merhaba kardeufim
i really do hope ai makes language barriers in reading and writing a thing of the past though i hope language learning can still thrive even with technology advances i donunumbert think ai can ever get to the point of fully understanding the nuances and creativity that can come from another language like humans can
i hope that ai keeps getting better at conversing with us as we learn the language imagine having an ai thatnumbers always there to help explaining all the details fixing pronunciation and helping with grammar and vocabulary it would make learning languages even more enjoyable and effective and when you add to this the possibility of live conversation we have the full package
as i native chinese speaker i can understand the translation very well had i not known your voice i would think you are a foreigner whonumbers been living in china for a very long time though there are a few moments where the choice of word is a bit odd not wrong but no one speaks like that i can definitely see how people may think this video is authentic
there will be no need to learn languages in the near future
i learned esperanto only because learning a language was something unattainable for me whole my life but esperanto just clicked after that i was learning languages out of love for languages their sound look grammar culture
youtube polyglots beware

why every video about ai has to do this quotoh all this was actually iaquot thing
giving a completely different answer to the title of your video ucwill ai kill language learningud ai couldunumberand shouldunumberbe used to iaugmenti language learning and is uniquely suited to do so because it can generate correct grammatical sentences iandi detect incorrect ones in target languages and will only get better to the extent that it doesnunumbert so itunumbers basically the language ucdrill sergeantud ucdrillud in terms of instruction that is with inexhaustible patiencebrbrdesigned properly a language learning ai could guide you through the basics of a language in a way that no textbook or current language app can because its responses and next steps would be based on your individual responsesunumberit would be flexibly tailored to you and based on your mistakes or simply at your request it could go over some point that you didnunumbert understand or allow you to practice some grammar point or construction with more and more varied examples it wouldnunumbert substitute for human tutors because there really is no substitute for human interactionunumberi read with regret that one commenter feels that his or her job as a professional language tutor has been ucautomated awayudunumberbut it could make selflearning or the time between language lessons a lot more productive and fun because you could spend a lot less time figuring out iwhati and ihowi to learn and a lot more just ilearningi
ai translation will only work for me if i have it what about the times i donnumbert have it
i speak german pretty well the translation and lipsynch matching was very convincing to me
i guess i understand your point i enjoy anime and i watch it with japanese voice actors but english subtitles still inumberm aware that there is a lot of nuance in the japanese language that inumberm missing and it has compelled me to learn some japanese
i study written chinese but inumberve never used it functionally and have never had a sustained conversation in chinese i have read classic novels in english translation like dream of red mansions story of the stone but i get a thrill from reading a few pages of cao xueqin in the original maybe someday inumberll be able to read a whole chapter in one sitting
there is value in connecting with a culture in business that includes learning the language connecting with people and not leaning on a translation device
for the german part it sounds like a machine so far odd choice of some words the rhythm and melody of the sentence is offbrbasically sounds like all those scam ads you get on youtube quotstudents found the perpetuum mobile and want to sell it on this hidden website you cannot find on google bit only on ads as the energy companies would otherwise close it downquot  yeah surebrwell maybe not as bad based on this small snippet but it does feel offbrmight change soon if they get real multimodal models out into the world
can you do a video on your accent and dialect it was very funny seeing people think you were not a native speaker of english lol
there is a problem with the structure of languages that seems to enable an accurate translation real time it will not happen in the short term
first of all my musical ear immediately picked up on a serious limitation of this software that i donnumbert really see how it could overcome and which would make real time translation impossible brthe software cannumbert make your voice produce a sound that wasnnumbert already in the audio you provided the software is sampling your voice and then rearranging the sounds you made as appropriate thing is sometimes a language needs a sound you didnnumbert provide the german section just doesnnumbert work because you didnnumbert say quotauquot or quotufcquot the first sound occurs in english but is very rare and thus was not in the audio file you provided the second sound just doesnnumbert occur in english not even allophonically in the standard dialect plus itnumbers also full of grammatical anglicisms the mandarin chinese only works because younumberre american ucft jufast suf hueppuens thucet unumbermuerudcuen ucngluecsh cufntueins thub sueme fuedve tufnes unumbers muendunumberruecn chuednuese sorry for that mess europeans if you were british it would not british english is missing the crucial middle tone it has high tone instead outside of east asia the only languages that have the correct five tones for mandarin are american standard english and the scandinavian languages and a norwegian would still end up sounding like a comedy character because the tones would be ridiculously exaggerated german has five tones but theynumberre the wrong ones french has only three spanish and italian have only two the turkish only works because english is one of the few languages that distinguishes quotchquot and quotshquot if you started with french audio it would fail not only is numberchnumber the same as numbershnumber but there is also no glide quotturueunumberyequot would come out as quotturshiuequot i highly doubt a turkish speaker would be amused or impressed if indeed that isnnumbert some sort of swearword the ai is only deciding how to rearrange the sounds you made it still cannot and probably never will be able to manufacture a sound that you did not actually provide to it brai will only ever be able to produce real time subtitles nor is the slight delay something which can ever be remedied think about how german verbs often come only at the end of the sentence no matter how good the ai is it will have to wait until the full sentence has been spoken before providing an accurate translation it will not get any better than this in the future sorry
inumberm actually kind of frightened that we are entering a world where nothing that we do is necessary doing things only for enjoyment seems pointless to me
native turkish and fluent german speaker here  the turkish part sounded really unnatural and not in the sense that it lacked the paralinguistic elements it sounds as though it was translated wordbyword german section was really robotic but no problems outside of that
ai only makes sense under capitalism if your goal is simply to be a more fufilled happy human being replacing opportunities for personal development with artifical tools makes no sense

the chip in the brain straight up hitchhikernumbers guide to the galaxy stuff quotbabelfishquot namesake of the old translation site you inserted a fish in your ear for instant interpretationbrbrthe turkish here was mostly grammatically correct albeit a little formal and textbookish fully understandable but sounds kinda unnatural
if ai does every little thing for us in the future life will be incredibly boring
i almost believed you were speaking turkish i thought you could totally have learned that language brfor mandarin and german i noticed especially for german because i bamb german and i can hear how you sound if younumberre actually speaking for mandarin it was the sound of the tones that werennumbert basb natural but still incredibly good learned mandarin myself the tones were very hard for me and i heard it a lot bri ofc also have to acknowledge that it could have been more obvious because i knewbrbrinumberm currently learning middle egyptian because inumberm studying archaeology and also know readspeak latin and ancient greek for these two languages wenumberre pretty confident in how it sounded but for egyptian we have barely an idea because they didnnumbert write their vowels we only have the consonant skeletonbrinumberd be bfascinatedb to see if ai would be able to better reconstruct the sounds for us by feeding it the reconstructed protolanguage the coptic derivates and sibling languages combined with bi or trilingual documents in eg ptolemaic greek or assyrian bri would love to know how ai could help us discover these things
i have no doubt that ai also can help with learning languages i was traveling in many countries that used to be a part of the ussr i was at an intermediate stage at that point in time and google translate was really useful the times that i either did not understand a word or the times i did not know a word would not mind having some type of ai glasses or ai earpices yo translate when im struggeling

studied abroad at one of the two best universities in all of asia for almost two years immersion only allowed to speak chinese and that chinese translation made me whip around while doing chores that takes years i knew ai translation was already amazing but i hadnnumbert heard it with mandarin until then jeese
not kill it but it will make it less and less useful which actually itunumbers not very useful today anywaybrlet me explain most people with good jobs or important positions in an enterprise or government hire other people to do that very job that ai will do in many countries even with a good life standard language learning is not seen necessary for most take spain for an instance despite living close to france buying stuff from america a country they love to say they hate but show how much they love and being ruled by germany since they are part of the eu are always claiming for everything to be translated to castilian otherwise they wonunumbert even look at it bronly a handful of people get to make a living out of learning a language most people do it for extreme necessity ei are immigrants or have to deal in a daily basis with people who speak another language for business or just for funbrit might not kill it but it sure will take it to the brink of extinction
the chinese rendition is actually terrible phonetically speaking the ai got every tone correct but when put together intonation is very rigid and moreover the translation itself is just not right
guys tech isnnumbert a god
yeah neologisms colloquiallisms names and surnames not accounted for in the ai database and even things as simple as the context of the conversation may be a difficult for ai to understand but the real question is are we really supposed to be as relient on technology as we are and even more in the future
inumberd like to mention two additional points at this issuebrbrnumber i think ai will never be able to understand context faithfully for example take the word quotspringquot it may be a season name a mechanical tool a source of water or an uprising so how do you translate quotarab springquot believe me some dumb journalist certainly used a translation tool and got quotprimavera uerabequot primavera  season and now the entire brazilian people says it this waybrbrnumber if you has read quotdunequot you will promptly understand this point the more you rely on machines to do your brain work the more younumberll be weak and dependent on them to learn how to emit a vowel or consonant or tone absent in your mother language is quite an exercise a challenge that gives you joy when you finally manage to do it well
i love how the entire society is experiencing essentially the modern art movement we have to redefine what makes human human as technology is catching up
it would mean closing the defense language institute in monterey california that valuable real estate can then be turned over to monterey and pacific grove for redevelopment
do you not think when real time langauge translation becomes practical it will mean that english is no longer useful as a lingua franca i know lots of young people nowadays globally are very keen to learn english due to how widespread it is in mass media and the web but maybe future generations wonnumbert bother trying to learn english sticking to their mother tongue
the german translation was way off i think the sentence structure was confusing for the ai and so the grammar was not correct also the voice sounded quite robotic it is not taking anybodyunumbers job yet uf
reading the title inumberd answer yes it most probably willbrmap technology already killed navigation skills with ai doing automatic translations why would anyone do the effort of learning a new language unless you just actually love learning languages and younumberre forever student but it will make the need to learn impractical and unnecessary
inumberm sad
turkish is ugly uf
the thing with turkish is no one speaks the perfect turkish like your ki literally no one even in formal situations the official turkish language isnt spoken like quothochdeutschquot there are always some nuances which differs you from a native to a professional learner speaking perfectly turkish cant be learned even if you are living number years in turkey thats a fact
ai can translate newspapers or bills of lading maybe stereo instructions however translating mother goose let alone fenagannumbers wake or the odes of pindar is another thing real indepth understanding will always require language learning ai translation will still be profoundly useful it just cannumbert cover all possibilities
you may also want to consider how some communities are really strict about learning their language most europeans speak english but not all europeans like to speak english with foreigners
i think one place where language learning wonnumbert go away is probably in military intelligence and itnumbers for that reason you said ai will probably struggle with the deeper nuances of languagebrbrinumberm a p cryptologic language analyst in the us army that specializes in korean and i can tell you that if they were to try and replace our job with ai it would be a disaster because ai relies on mass data consumption from across the internet in order to produce but what if the target is extremely numbershynumber like the north koreans are north koreanumbers internet footprint is extremely small so an ai couldnnumbert do my job because therenumbers too little data for them to use and this is true for a lot of other enemies to the us especially those in africa and the middle east places that donnumbert have as robust a connection to the internet
inumberm not real
the first part of the german doesnnumbert seemed completly correct the second part is more or less correct but didnnumbert sound as german native speaker brhowever that flaws were not too big and one could get what you or ai are trying to say in some years it will barely distinctable from real people like a news anchors
wherever two languages have different word orders it is impossible to translate until enough is known about the input and that makes it unsuitable for live translationbras for the translated video it quotsynchronizesquot the lips and messes up everything else doing so it is very obvious the translation into german isnnumbert bad but i very obvious automatically translated
i love my intermediate german for all the reasons paul describes and i was thrilled to recently spend a week in berlin and use it all the time even things like taking the german tours in museums not the english tour bri find that ai is super helpful for countless questions i have in german as shown in a random dialogue i had with ai this morning bra hrefhttpsbqwebpageblogspotcomnumbernumberchatgpttutorsintermediategermanhtmlmnumberhttpsbqwebpageblogspotcomnumbernumberchatgpttutorsintermediategermanhtmlmnumbera

as a language enthusiast who also works in the realm of speech technologies i feel ai shouldnunumbert be a replacement but a complement of language learning there will be novel teachinglearning methods thanks to the revolution of llms and they may clear many barriers in the learning of some difficult languages like mandarin and arabic or even ancient languages they can also be leveraged to preserve the endangered languages by encouraging more people to learn them with more intelligentaccessibleimmersive approaches

as a nonnative speaker of german that does bsoundb correct but obviously not native and donnumbert use it oftenbrso infrequently that i did have to rely on the subtitles to doublecheck but it sounded good
i think there will be circumstances where these new machine translation tools will come up short older computer games for example may not play well with on the fly text or speech translations also for newer works a human translator will be the first step of quality control for translations of prerecorded speech or prewritten text

i can genuinely relate with paulnumbers language learning experience as a nonnative english speaker i have never given english language the attention it deserves as the expression of a complex culture and history just because for me itnumbers more of a quotfunctionalquot language itnumbers a lingua franca and you often end up speaking it but i may be somewhat more interested in other languages even if or maybe because you rarely get to speak it just as paul i learn them to understand news books and online content rather than to speak them for me functionality is the least important driver of interest in a language for the rest language learning is an exclusively human experience itnumbers the journey that matters not the destination

learning a second language improved my life and help me fight depression that started with me after puberty in highschool number years later my life is way better
even though chatgpt style quotaiquot has been around for a while now google translate has been around for far longer and it is notoriously unreliable brbrmaybe the new generative algorithims which is what the current ai really is computers arennumbert conscious just yet are at least better than google translate but i donnumbert believe they will fully replace translators at the very least real translators would still be needed to correct mistakes in the generative language model brbreven if documents can be quottranslatedquot by the algorithm a human translator will still need to be paid to do a grammar and content check because algorithms arennumbert great with context emotional intent or localisation from an algorithm you may only get a transliteration which still has to be translated by a person brbras for the brain chipsit may be possible someday but the current technology seems unsafe given the reports about neuralinknumbers animal trials breven when thatnumbers fixed i think many people would view it as an extreme privacy violation and not use it ultimately though whatever happens with ai i think younumberre right that people will want to learn languages anyway to make more friends and understand different cultures and perspectives
i donnumbert believe that ai wonnumbert be able to speak idioms slangs and local dialects it already does it
the added clips in foreign languages reminded me of me hanging around with friends and using all the languages we learnt uf just switching into one of them makes us happy so as a hobby it stays for many years but for work and other essential tasks such as first help or excursions ai will substitute peopleunumbers knowledgeufa
the german one was kinda weird
i think that ai will make language skills less functional and more recreational there will always be people who want to learn a language because itnumbers fun and interesting a new language enables you to make new friends it adds a whole new dimension to travel abroad and how can you study a culture without studying the language that goes with it you might not need a second language for work but employers will always be impressed with the application and mental agility of a person who has learned a foreign language people always warm to you when you speak their languagebran increasing number of people are learning languages of their forebears ai will never replace the joy that comes of being part of a language revitalization movementbrinumberm getting old now and i learn new languages to exercise my brain in order to stave off dementia there is no finer exercise for the brain than taking on a new language inumberm studying sanskrit nowbrand one wouldnnumbert want to use an ai interpreter in the boudoir would one

iunumberm a language teacher and learner i donunumbert think ai will ever fully replace native speakers due to all the reasons you mentioned learning a language is also about learning the culture and connecting with people ai canunumbert do that i also substitute my learning with ai and other sources like yt and movies but it doesnunumbert replace having a teacher fyi all my language teachers have been online
i learn languages and about languages because somehow i am caught by them their sound their structure i never thought of them as a tool to make money i think that ai can also be of great help for learning a new language by the way the german ai translation of your voice is perfect i canunumbert speak turkish but i paid attention to you and couldnunumbert tell if it was you or not speaking it i thought ucwow he is also fluent in turkishud
with chinese being my l i say that the ai generated chinese is incredible despite the obvious foreign acceent not sure whether the accent is intentional or a result of imperfect program
the short answer is no we language lovers like me learn languages because we love the experience to know new words to know how to pronounce new sounds itnumbers a passion not about economy or industry if someone has enough time and the passion will continue learning languages even if quotaiquot acquire god tier intelligence this quotaiquot shit is pointless in many areas
awesome video but i really missed quotthank you for watching and have a nice day quot at the end
honestly iunumberm scared ai might replace everything at some point
ai is totally useless without electricity
so ai will help us with work however it will not be able to replace humanity we will need to get more in touch with our emotions and understanding who we are so that we can become better people being authentic will matter more than being ucusefuludcool
as a native speaker the german one definitely sounds robotic but itnumbers perfectly understandable the problem is that it doesnnumbert like a native but also not like someone who learned german later on it really is in the uncanny valley for me
as a native chinese speaker i think the translation is just perfect if i didnnumbert watch your previous videos i would thought you learned chinese secretly and had mastered it although the tone seems a little unnaturalnot like human but therenumbers no mistakes i can find and itnumbers really impressive
inumberve noticed similar reactions to ai across other fields such as software and art where those reactions can sure get more lively than with language learning in all three fields people seem concerned about keeping their jobs as much as they are interested in the techbrbryounumberre also not the only one who thinks ai will make human works more valuable and i agree here the rise of ai simply made me more motivated to create stuff which seems to be the opposite of most people
i learn languages fir tge same reason
even if ai can translate in realtime with number accuracy it still cannumbert beat the experience of actually knowing a language
nobut it will make it all better
well the german part sounds pretty convincing although unnatural paul the problem is you cannumbert compensate for illiteracy ai isnnumbert ai but machine learning and i see that google bing and yandex translation tools are still messing up when the texts donnumbert follow writing standards regarding syntax and orthographybrbrai to me is just a numberbuzzwordnumber and is far fetch from being good enough to replace humans in several activities machine learning the right term from a programmernumbers standpoint is full of biases which are inherited from the people who programmed and trained them
i have been teaching languages for number years and i will say that number of people learn languages because they need to if there is no need they will not learn the ones who study languages for fun are so few that their amount is totally negligible so if this video is right there will be no language learning pretty soon
i still refuse to use the backup camera on a car
can ai speak colloquial australianbrnot bloody likely mate
i see how ai language is an amazing tool if all of a sudden you need to communicate in klingon or perhaps elvish i find that really cool but not for personal interaction language connects you with the culture perhaps thatnumbers why esperanto never became an official language of anything there is no people or culture behind it inumberm sure that if they made elvish a universal language it will be far more popular albeit fictitious the is an amazing culture and people behind the language besides who wouldnnumbert want to be an elveufuf
contrasting your views on ais effects on your personal wheelhouse to artistnumbers views is interesting
looooove the dig at elon musk that had me busting out laughing
good in theory i believe ai would have a massive issue with many idioms expressions understanding tones of language  no not tonal languages but tone of voice to express themselves brcertain stress factors and the nuisances of any language that present itselfbrbrgoogle translate for instance only get about number of the entire message with multiple paragraphs which is complex difficult and hard to pose understandingbrbrdonnumbert think a i will completely takeover language learning incredible less so languages themselves too much pride on the line and many nowdays countries fought for those territories and language presided
well said ai will make many things obsolete but never human connection nor our natural curiosity nor our need for self expression these are powerful motivators
i believe itnumbers not just about business or formal conversations but also culture think of multilingual countries for example like canada belgium switzerland etc where i personally believe people should have a decent understanding of the languages and cultures within their countrynumbers boundaries as itnumbers prominent to keep their national identities and keep them integrated there are also dying languages that will become even more irrelevant if ai completely replaces language learning as they most likely wonnumbert support them or would have really bad quality

german native here  the translation in my opinion works well but i would at this stage not recommend using it outside of the business world let alone due to the countless nuances a language has it is hard to exactly deliver the message you meant to with the tool i could imagine i think there is a reason why people can recognise automatically translated things and go quotoh that sounds like google translatequot for example even though you could technically speak every language in the world with such an ai tool it wont make you truly master it there is so much more to it than just words the countrynumbers culture the social status of your conversation partner and so on but it is still really impressive
one other benefit of language learning is that itnumbers very stimulating for the brain and makes you more eloquent in your own tongue imo it just makes you a more interesting person therenumbers some indication that it may make you less likely to develop dementia or alzheimernumbers later in life though the jury is still out on that
native chinese speaker here  the chinese did not sound natural
the thing is ai cannot understand context and there are homonyms that are very likely to be mistranslated
will this mean that interpreting and translating jobs will be unnecessary

paul finding your video on scandinavian languages lead me on a journey in learning about languagesalso jackson crawford with ai inumberll still be interested in learning
i completely agree paul i think most of the people who like learning languages do it because of the reasons you mentioned because we love how it feels to be able to understand this or that in the languages that we like so really hope that even if we have those incredible tools in the near future people will keep interested in learning languages because itnumbers a great experience bralso we help our brains against alzheimer uf

hiiiii can you make a video about sign languages thabks
inumberm learning chinese ai makes learning chinese so much easier i can have conversations in chinese about whatever i want whenever i want for as long as i want and nobody gets impatient or annoyed at my chinese when it malfunctions
i find ai very useful for learning some new vocabulary and reading customised short texts anyway its always me who give it orders and the brain remains mine
so how many languages does paul currently speak 
inumberm brazilian and love very much german culture and language and also dutch i studied them read them hear songs from pop into classical music in those languages ai will never change this love those languages which are not really important to teacher tasks in brazil in which most of sources are in portuguese spanish or english
itunumbers great for when you really need to get your point across with a language barrier but i havenunumbert changed my duolingo goals yet
i was really interested to see and hear you using that software to speak languages i would love to see more of this for me i would like to see you try out finnish
i liked the fact that you did an opinion piece i almost entirely agree  except for the neural link part something like the knowledge of a language is too complex at least going on from the technique we use today
i could definitely tell your chinese seemed off i cannumbert put my finger on it but some uncanny valley effect
i had a very unpleasant experience last week someone who saw and knew i was learning many languages felt i was a nerd who had no life i could imagine for this person language learning is only a functional skill something to impress people or put on a cv what they cannumbert see is what language actually is how it can be a fascinating activity in its own right how it is window into other cultures and hence the world outside of the english speaking one being an affront to the dominance of english and english media and arrogance of its speakers is a good enough reason alone
another excellent video never disappoints
for turkish yes it is pretty good however your tone is a little bit monotone and the stress is not correctly given for grammer there are some small problems because of the confusion between simple present tense and prensent continuous tense we dont use simple present in some contexts instead naturally we use present continuous although the meaning is simple present in englishbri am really impressed it is one of the best idea after formal quotwearingquot tools in zoom meetings
inumberm trying to learn polish in order to help with my genealogy research the classes inumberve tried seem to be focused on modern conversational language but i just want to be able to read and understand old documents since many of the th century documents inumberve found are hand written in cursive polish and german even modern young people can no longer read them so inumberve learned to read the old polish and fraktur german cursive scripts and have to transcribe the letters into ascii text then copy and paste into an online translating tool this is tedious so i hope ai will get better at scanning and translating such texts
the pronunciation of the german video was pretty good but the sentence structure sounded unnatural so it was easy to tell that it was created by aibrand what you said about the additional level of authenticity of genuine language learning is so true there is such a deep and unconscious connection when you hear someone speaking in your native dialect and there is this great feeling of achievement when you managed to express yourself in a foreign language even if not perfectly and i also like how you learn to see the world from many different angles
inumberve learnt romanian to impress the girls and they are damn impressed my feeling about it is great will ai implant impress that much nope

inumberve been following futurist thinkers technological progress and contemplating the singularity for nearly number years itnumbers surreal seeing mainstream society and other numbernormiesnumber talking openly about something inumberve kept in my private thoughts for most of my life inumberm struggling to even describe the feeling itnumbers like a television show as big as game of thrones or breaking bad just came out and the setting is my own neighborhood the convenience store i go into all the time the streets i walk down all the time and the entire world is talking about itbrbri mention it here because seeing it talked about on this channel is the biggest breakdown of separation of worlds inumberve experienced yet the news talking about it is almost normal and teachers i work with complaining about chatgpt and google translate has felt mostly normal
the turkish part was enough to counter the argument it was unnatural the way words were arranged and pronouns were used
ai will probably never be able to translate languages with few speakers in sweden we have at least number small indigenous languages spoken by up to a few thousand people it will take like a thousand years for ai to collect enough information to be able to translate them and there is many languages lika that around the world
ai will only get faster cheaper and omnipresent also better as users require but one great ability of chatbots is to chat ai will be the best language tutors possible patient attentive and able to track progress and add new vocabulary as needed

iunumberm currently learning japanese and no matter how frustrating it gets i have never dreamed to have someone snap their fingers and instantly make me fluent in japanese language learning is such a joy and i would hate to lose the chance to experience it with the language i want to learn the most
i prefer learning or speak new language instead of using ai translation i desire to be multilingual uf
i probably overheard this but the beginning of the german translation is a bit odd there is no article even though inumberd expect one ein video or plural wo article videos regardless of whether the translation is just supposed to seamlessly switch from chinese over to german or not but thatnumbers meckern auf hohem niveau from an angehende dolmetscherin 
perfect ai translation is possible only if the ai fully understands the context otherwise it contains mistakes
i want no chip nowhere close to my brain
as a native turkish speaker i can say the turkish part was perfect not a single mistake or an offbeat sentence wow
perfection maybe best video so far ufaa keep it up
ai will be mostly on the commercial applications of anything as you mentioned for the geeks language will be always in our hearts for whatever reason unumber

i definitely will i like the manual effort of putting focus into languages too i donunumbert like using never use ucsmartud devices like siri or alexa because i find talking to technology makes you mentally lazy the more we become dependent on technology the less of our brain power is used technology is a good tool but it should never be a replacement of your own abilities that you possess i started learning languages basically by accident i was experiencing intense social anxiety where i didnunumbert want to go out in public and i didnunumbert really have friends because of it and i used languages to help me overcome social anxiety it also taught me the power of giving before i learned languages i never saw the value of giving because i felt like i didnunumbert have anything value to give learning languages is truly the ultimate act of giving you give comfort to people since the people know you put your heart into learning their culture and languageunumber

the most important comments inumberve read so far coincide with those in my industry which is art and entertainment the problem with ai is that it might start to put in danger whole careers and employments works and employments that have been earned through academic preparation and degrees it is not the automatization of manual labor and low skill employments wenumberre talking about people who have dedicated their whole lives to linguistics language learning art and design literature and writing there is a reason hollywood entered a huge strike recently ai might put in danger and make unstable some of the most sought after and beloved careers we have

younumberre a man after my own heart paul and you have a nose after my own nose celtic ai cannumbert rob us of that practicality has never driven my passion for languages the only language inumberve ever learned of necessity is arabic for the navy i was a translator and i hated it and was terrible at it the whole ten years of my professional involvement with it it wasnnumbert until years later after regaining my faith in jesus christ that my heart toward it changed i had deliberately forgotten most of my arabic and one day i came to my senses numberwhat am i doing inumberm an idiot to want to lose this giftnumber so i began praying to god for help with relearning the language and reading the bible in arabic i had never prayed for help with it before the change was immediate and astonishing before long i was far better than i had ever been before and instead of antipathy i now had a new and enthusiastic love for the arabic language  and the bible years later my fire is still burning ardentlybrbri share all this because you mentioned loving biblical greek and hebrew which i am also learning and love in fact inumberm going to be studying them this coming year at university as part of my theology major admittedly thatnumbers the part inumberm most excited about ufa so now my question is are you a christian toobrbrthanks if you read all this god bless you
paul your office is all fancy now  german translation is good enough but with no regionalism at all  remember everyone ai is just a computer theynumberre fooling you into buying more products by scaring you with personal computers which are number years old what we should be afraid of is laziness selfishness and entitlement which is all that ai technology and silicon valley has to sell
totally agree language is the most human thing
number agreed with all points aside from wearable technology cause that sounds very farfetched
as a german native the translation was perfectly understandable but appeared somewhat unnatural in a few places and the pronunciation felt slightly off too robotic
you would like to watch a scene from a scifi tvshow called quotstar trek discovery universal translator malfunctionquotbrthe quotuniversal translatorquot is a never wellexplained and neverconsistently used device that somehow makes people who talk vastly different languages to understand each other more details in memory alpha the wiki of star trek and multiple videosbrthe first and only time so far a malfunction of the universal translator has been portrayed was in that scene  and the person who saved the day was the only officer who had made the effort to learn languagesbrenjoy
currently english seems to be the defacto international language do you think ai will decrease the amount of people actually fluent in english as english learners rely more on ai to translate conversations for them
as speaker of chinese and german i would say that the ai generated speech is already good enough to deliver formal idea
i am learning chinese
hello paul you are addressing an extremely relevant topic herebrbrforeign languages are already hardly a part of the curriculum for most englishspeaking countries ai translations will simply help people beratebelittle and insult language geeks by saying quotwhy are you wasting time on learning french when you could be learning some much more useful stem subjectquotbrnon english speaking countries that are fighting to balance their budget could be striking foreign languages entirely to save money spent on educationbrbrthat said it will certainly be useful to be able to find a doctor and describe onenumbers symptons when visiting any country no matter the language brbrthe greatest challenge i see for ai is learning to deal with shades of meaning synonims and language registers including the speech levels typical of asian languages

i am currently learning hawaiian in my free time therenumbers no way an ai at least for now and probably for a long time would be able to make a speech sound as natural as a native speaker could make chatgpt and google translate both create some weird sentences as well this all happens due to the fact that hawaiian content is meager it is hard to find good content for languages like hawaiian okinawan greenlandic basque etc it would need more work or maybe they wonnumbert even have any type of person working on them because the population of these languages is small anyway moreover languages are always evolving in every place some people might use some expressions more locally and come up with new expressions as a result an ai would need to follow this evolution
wow der deutsche teil hufrt sich unfassbar echt an
you should be more clear which dialect you mean when you say ucchineseud i donunumbert think itunumbers wise to marginalize other dialects
i already speak a few languages why stop now
iunumberm a professional translator and aside from short phrases or sentences automated translation like googe translate pretty much always require human revision so i think at least for a certain period of time human intervention is necessary to have the most accurate translation
i use ai a lot yet i continue to learn french slowly as well as enjoyment inumberm getting older and inumberm well aware i need to keep my brain active  use it or lose it having an ai do everything for me wonnumbert help me maintain my mental faculties i donnumbert speak french with anyone just yet but come retirement inumberll go and give some french people something to laugh at for sure
inumberm a language teacher and inumberve noticed that when the students who love the language theynumberre studying are the ones who really get ahead and they always prefer classes in person i believe human teachers make the learning process very personal and as a result more meaningful enjoyable and memorable ah and those students usually hate online lessons uf i havennumbert found until this day one student who liked online classes let alone learning with ai probably those who need to learn a language for work are more ok with that

an ai application can only be as good as the data would the training data include everything you would enjoy probably not unless itnumbers a personalized set of data that you can confirm the completeness so the wholesale llms wouldnnumbert and couldnnumbert replace number of language use the risk is when those llms make say number of language use number cheaper the remaining number use wouldnnumbert justify the much higher resource to invest and improve itnumbers like when cheap frozen chicken meat is vastly available then the majority would just take the deal and forget about raising their own chicken of course there will be people would know the savory taste of freshly prepared chicken meat and create its demand and market but for those who are born in a world of llms the number use would become niche that people would find difficult even remembering existed
ai will never eliminate the need to learn upper pelonian which no one currently speaks but pelonians and translate the bible into it almonian or elmonian and pelonian are placeholder languageethnicity names
as a native turkish speaker even though there were some minor mistakes in the translation it was pretty good and i am pretty surprised by it
i somewhat disagree ai will make easier to learn languages too letnumbers not forget that learning languages is difficult because of the current system that doesnnumbert want to move on from the way things were done in the past your classical text book in your school class when we finally move on from that into comprehensive input as a standard and ai helps us to enhance it which will also have itnumbers cost itnumbers not easy the act of learning a language will be enhanced too you have to look at demographics as well learning languages is good for who for the average middlemiddle upper class europeannorth american developed country person yes it has its benefits but this is more important for the migrants who want to change their lifestyle if they want to be assimilated the country itself will put the money needed to make the integration much faster and that includes language too it will be like that for various decades since itnumbers unlikely that countries like germany france or nordic ones are gonna be okey with just english for everything you have to adjust to the countrynumbers customs and that includes language yes i think language learning will change many activities will now be possible to be made with ai and thatnumbers awesome but the usefulness of a language goes beyond a job these days and the demographics just show that if developed countries want to survive and they are not having children at the rate they need to do sothey are gonna need to integrate the people from outside thatnumbers gonna carry a lot more than just language but as you can probably tell language is gonna be important donnumbert let anyone fool you big changes take time give it up from number to number years before thinking that we could truly discard learning a new language and thatnumbers still a longshot considering the demographic crisis in the developed world making language learning easier with ai will enhance the quantity and quality of qualified people entering the job markets of those countriesbrbralso as an added bonus for me the coolest stuff wenumberll get due to ai is finally a new standard for dubbing and subtitling for dubbed content i wanna learn a language with the content i love not just the content i have available in itnumbers origin form i wanna learn german with a japanese show dubbed in german but the dub itself doesnnumbert have a subtitle with the idioms of the german dubthatnumbers a big bother and the same goes for other dubs like arabic but thatnumbers for the future damn i envy my children already they are gonna have it much easier uf just imagine the automatic translations explanations of the grammar and context and natural audio with emotion all in one from even picking a physical book with those interesting looking glasses i want a model with the design of xmennumbers cyclops please ufe it will be easier guys we are assuming things will disappear from having a practical use but technology makes things easier to work around too itnumbers a new and interesting era and just like anyone else if you are worried about your labour stability we better get upgraded with the new tech and think of the ways in which we can use it to enhance our productivity inumberm already thinking of all the content i will be able to enjoy because of ai can you imagine merging lingopie with ai as a tech and language enthusiast inumberm extremely happy many boring tasks will disappear and i will be able to express my love for cultures and exchange much easier to my children because of ai too
i think learning new language than what you already know is a talent and whether or not ai is going to make it useless if a person is optimistic about learning language they will not derail themself from their track brfor me itnumbers always gonna be a no no i never gonna leave learning a language even when inumberll be busy with my works the little happiness after learning a language is very big for me and also after learning a language and observing it inumberm trying to make my own language and thatnumbers all i want different languages have different type of grammer sounds alphabets and thatnumbers also one of my favorite thing inumberm learning it anyway despite the fact that it will not gonna help me in anyway in my life or atleast in the next number year and those whonumberre upset about it just one thing to say  we do many thing in our life which is useless and many times we regret it but in this case np matter how useless this process is this is definitely not regretful
for anyone who actually enjoys the feeling of accomplishing learning a new language loves to see the progress of those neurons connecting in their brain and watching as nonesense sounds slowly become distinguishable speech no the idea that ai will kill said desire is a joke inumberd be much more worried if i were an artist or actor not to say ai is going to take those professions away any time soon or the joy of learning to draw or act for that matter
i still dislike ai for many reasons fastermore efficient isnunumbert always better weunumberre going to lose touch with much of our own humanity even speaking the language in business settings translating basic spanish and chinese to my foreign coworkers is a special human thing brbrwe keep pushing for things to get better without looking at how it can makes things worse i think a lot of this has to do with how depressed the recent couple generations are brbrmaybe iunumberm just a whiny grandpa
so star trek
excluding my native language english i study a little bit of four languages and a not very little bit of one and if there was no functional reason to learn a language inumberd definitely stop studying asl and spanish but inumberd still study tongva french and especially dutch i already only do because i want to and tongva is an extinct language anyway the ai cannumbert have any effect on my desire to learn those plus i imagine it will be quite a while before ai can completely take away any functional reason to learn a language donnumbert know though

good point about language learning for enjoyment sticking around there are lots of anime with plenty good english dubs but i choose japanese because i like it
will ai kill it absolutely not and imo you mention the most salient aspects as to why it will no happen interestingly enough it may lead to a decrease in the knowledge of the lingua franca of the moment currently of course english as it usually is not a passion project  just something you get through exposure and because of necessity brbras a professional simultaneous interpreter i expect my field to disappear at one point or another but really not in the near future the tech still simply isnnumbert good enough there are particularly two things that i see as major obstacles for ai to take over the field brbrfirstly speech isnnumbert perfect people eg mispronounce a lot and often leave things unsaid and the listener corrects and fills in or just take a sudden turn in the middle of a sentence additionally in some languages speakers never seem to put a full stop in their speech at all which absolutely does not comply with the rules of other languages add to that ia all the regional varieties and the differences between spoken and written language and i myself find it fairly hard to imagine that ai will soon get up to a sufficient level where it can cope with everything i have mentioned brbrsecondly and maybe more importantly the extralinguistic features of the speakers the same words of a sentence can be interpreted differently just on the basis of what the speakers emphasise or their tone as well as of their gestures and demeanour to be able to cope with this we really are going to need something much more than an ai that is more or less a mere translationinterpreting device it has to be a true intelligence
reading the comments and thinking about paulnumbers answers but especially being a grammar teacher and a specialist in languages native to the americas thatnumbers such a long sentence that i would like to see ai translate that and wenumberre not done yet uf i think a few things are overlookedbrnumber there are roughly number living languages on this planet sure ai will tackle english  chinese french turkish and other big ones but thatnumbers only because of the human input from speakers of those languages believe me nobody will bother to quotteachquot ai small indigenous languages like warao from ecuador palikur of french guyana or halkomelem the native language of the place where paul is from if inumberm correct let alone the different dialects of these languagesbrnumber speaking of dialects accents variants etc a german speaker and turkish speaker already mentioned this what ai quotspeaksquot is an extreme form of a standardised language otherwise said itnumbers not speaking at all it like a chess computer they donnumbert play chess they calculate incredibly well chess however is so much more playing with ones nerves for examplebrnumber brings me to the last point there is a difference between speaking a language and reproducing it speaking is with emotions feelings etc i doubt ai will be able to reproduce these so far itnumbers all human imput
wow you are way too optimistic i donnumbert doubt that ar headsets will eventually be able to translate things in real time but i think younumberre forgetting that most people cannumbert afford this luxury wearable tech and brainchips cost thousands of dollars duolingo is free
paulbryou forgot to mention another reason why some folks learn foreign languages keeping your brain active it becomes more important as you get older i wouldnunumbert call myself old yet but i have been learning french for the last number years exactly for that
inumberm a german teacher and the german was spot on no mistakes
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera yes because languages will lose a lot of meaning a lot even by an accurate translationbralso til now translations also make plenty of mistakesbrfor example my other comment about the turkish speechbrthe ai doesnnumbert understand the interpretation of for ucfor exampleud he just translates like a bot

i would never in my enitre life trade the fun experience that is learning a new language that inumberm really interested in no matter how hard the language in question is to learn or whether will i ever really need skills of that language in my life later and all the funny mistakes all the fun discoveries you make along that waybrbrnot to mention all the brain candy you get while learning a language the shocked and confused faces of your relatives your friends seeing you speak a language they donnumbert understand and the surprised andor joyful faces of native speakers not expecting you to communicate with them like a local may your attempts at that be flawless like of a native speaker or a little bit silly
ai cannot replace learning local cultures and conventions and as you point out facetoface interactions are another order of activity than videos inumberm glad you also mentioned ancient languages ai cannot get into ancient languages and cultures with all their unknowns and ambiguities only a human mind can grapple with those
native turkish speaker and translator here while the translation wasnnumbert bad and it got the point across there were a couple errors that make it obvious this is a machine translation and the voice sounds a bit robotic as well but depending on the quotqualityquot expected by the client it could be good enough given time most companies could use a tool like this for most translations
the german created by the ai tool sounded a little bit electronic but the grammar was good
english speaker learning spanish and frenchlearning other languages is more than just word substitution because learning other languages is also learning different ways of thinking
i doubt ai will completely replace human translation particularly for dead languages i once tried to converse with chatgpt in anglosaxon and it was atrocious chatgpt invented words and endings every sentence had numerous mistakes i later tried it with latin and it was better but even then it still made up words
ai definitely make me forgot my turkish bruhh
thank you paul i totally agree with youbrbrinumberm learning welsh currently people often say itnumbers quotuselessquot because almost all welsh native speakers can speak perfect english or spanish if they are in patagonia but i still want to learn inumberm living in wales i love welsh culture and history i see the welsh people fighting for the destiny of the language i want to respect their efforts i want to talk to them in their native tongue rather than in english brbreven if nobody speaks a language so what itnumbers just peoplenumbers nerdy hobby learning a language makes me happy and makes many people happy does klingon have many speakers but itnumbers very important to star trek fans brbrby the way the invention of bikes cars and trains makes running much less functional but many people still love running

why do people still draw and paint when they can just as easily take a photograph why do people continue to read and write books when we have tv and movies therenumbers so much more to the experience of language learning that the practical application for a lot of us the journey is its own reward
now inumberm number sure you are an ai it doesnnumbert make you less awesome though
it is without a doubt that ai will eventually be so adept at translation to the point where every human translator gets replaced by an ai one
br
brnevertheless translation is inherently an imperfect process wherein the transfer of information from one language to another seldom occurs without alterations a striking illustration of this phenomenon is the challenge posed by definite articles such as englishnumbers quotthequot arabicnumbers quotalquot and portuguesenumbers quotoquot when translated into languages lacking definite articles such as chinese russian or turkish these linguistic nuances often become obscured or omitted
br 
branother example lies in languages with perfect tenses consider the phrase quotwill have eatenquot in english which can be relatively straightforward to translate into spanish due to the existence of future perfect tenses in both languages however this ease of translation becomes less apparent when dealing with languages like tagalog which lacks an equivalent future perfect tense in such cases conveying the precise temporal nuances inherent in the english expression becomes a more intricate task requiring careful consideration of alternative linguistic structures and expressions in the target language this highlights the unique challenges posed by specific linguistic features that may not have direct counterparts across diverse language systems
br
brkorean honorifics present yet another challenge in translation these linguistic conventions deeply embedded in the fabric of korean communication carry subtle nuances of respect and formality that may not have direct equivalents in other languages such as english as a result the intricacies of honorifics may be lost or inadequately conveyed during the translation process
br
brfurthermore humor particularly in the form of jokes constitutes a fascinating dimension of linguistic expression it is a wellestablished observation that jokes often lose their intended humor and cultural resonance when translated the play on words cultural references and linguistic nuances that make a joke amusing in one language may not seamlessly transition to another language leading to a loss of comedic impact
br
brthe points mentioned above are but a few examples that underscore the inherent complexities and limitations in translation processes ranging from the nuances of definite articles to the challenges posed by perfect tenses honorifics and the delicate art of humor these intricacies highlight that to fully grasp the richness of a culture relying solely on translation may not be the most effective approach instead a more comprehensive understanding emerges through direct language acquisition learning the language yourself not only enhances your ability to navigate linguistic subtleties but also provides invaluable insights into the cultural nuances that shape communication therefore while ai continues to advance in translation capabilities the depth of cultural understanding achieved through language learning remains unparalleled

i was shocked to learn just yesterday that a dutch man inumberd thought bilingual in english really isnnumbert i wrote to ask him a question and he answered that he couldnnumbert answer because his translator app couldnnumbert handle my wording
i mean the german part was understandable but if you said quotor if i want to create a video that goes viral in germany and austriaquot  this is not exactly what the ai said it should have said quotoder wenn ich ein video erstellen will dass in deutschland und udsterreich viral geht oder gehen wird kann ich es in deutsch ufcbersetzenquot it kind of cut off the part quotor if i wantquot i mean you can still kind of get what is being said but the first sentence is not complete

ai cannot solve the fundamental problem of translation intranslatibility because it is unsolvable translation is an art not a science ai will not make language learning obsolete  in the same way that even when books are available in translation you will always find people willing to learn a language in order to enjoy them in their original version
i think younumberre right paul but the language learning market will shrink dramatically and thatnumbers bad news for teachers
at most learning another language will be a simply a matter of personal pride and development but even that will be a long time in the future ais that can reliably interpret one language to another donunumbert exist yet and it will be a long time before they are common enough to make learning new languages and cultures impractical

when i try to speak spanish with a native spanish speaker the reaction is always uccringe dude just speak englishud
turkish translation is really good not just grammar or vocabulary but also intonation and accent it is not perfect though yet younumberd have study turkish for a decade to do it better than the ai

inumberm a native mandarin speaker yes inumberm very impressed i think it imitates how nonnative people tried to learn chinese the tone is somewhat unnatural and a little robotic when it says quotzhong guo renquot chinese people itnumbers a very typical or stereotypical foreign accent but overall the tone is very good the grammar is flawless if a nonnative speaker can speak mandarin like this i would say quotyour mandarin is perfectquot
that is crazy paul is going to take all our jobs turkish was almost perfect except for one small mistake in parallelism in tense in translation of uche doesnunumbert speak turkishud it had to be uche is not speaking turkishud to sound right in turkish
wow here i was wondering for a while if inumberll ever see a video a video on ai vs language learning great bygones are the days where people say quotsorry for bad language i helped myself with google translatequot no now itnumberll be quothi i am fluent in language even in a b and c inumberll even put that on my cv bcz f you also if you ask me to talk to you in language face to face well f you i donnumbert owe you any proof aka chat gpt will numberwritenumber for me and some audio ai will numberspeaknumber for mequotbrbrthis is this is litterally the same case scuenario as ai genrating images at this point a true detriment to actually learning a skill and an propeller for enabling laziness a general derriment to quotbeing curiousquot really why all that whatnumbers the point of having an ai do this for you
ai video didnnumbert seems natural
i totally agree with your analysis the pleasure i derive from learning speaking reading and listening to other languages will never be provided by ai translation all that this new technology can do is send me back to my native language so whatnumbers the fun of it
honestly i was waiting for you to make a video on this topic since the day i came across this ai tool itnumbers like a real linguist finally coming face to face with an ai linguistuf
ucufef
very interesting video i donnumbert think language learners need to fear the development of ai any time soon humans can give things meaning and interpret that meaning in many ways whereas ai can only mimic patterns and know what patterns look like be it a novel an essay and even facial expressions our individual uses of languages like slang and the unique connections of multilingual speakers make between their languages cannot be replicated easily
i will personally never use these automatic translation tools unless itnumbers mandatory at work
as a turk i can say that the turkish voice of ai was funny and good
love the way you teach and explain your points youunumberre funny but does not distract from the information you convey thank you
if the turkish and german natives were impressed by the ai results then i think language learning will become more of a niche interest as functional needs are taken care of by better iterations of ai to those who say it wonnumbert replace dialects and localisations i would counter by asking how long a learner needs to get beyond functionality and to use idiom and dialect fluidly most will never get to that point
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera what you say here paul hits very close to home i am american but learned how to speak portuguese and spanish i founded an imports business in number i import mostly handcrafted items from latin america knowing the languages of my destination countries  and something about their cultures  has bridged the gaps and brought me closer to the people inumberve done business with this is something not taught in business school i have an mba i have had numerous instances where people felt honored that i would care enough to learn their language i wish i had a lempira a peso or a real for every time someone said to me something like quotof all the other americans who have come down here you are the only one to speak to us in our languagequot and next year i celebrate number years in business i feel that bridging the gap through language has had a lot to do with the longevity of my business please people donnumbert lean on ai for everything
inumberm a native german speaker and the german one seemed less ai than you speaking english uf
interesting videobras a professional translator here are my two centsbri use machine translators like deepl or google translate in the same way that a driver uses their gps system  it can speed up my work by giving me prompts but there are two big quotbutsquotbrfirstly at least in my usual language combination those systems can be okish at very simple texts but they flounder when the text has any level of complexity using them to generate texts that i would then postedit would not be viable for me it simply takes more time and effort than actually doing a translation those systems will eventually remove lowend translators from the market  those translators who spew out large quantities of poorquality text for low prices clients simply wonnumbert pay that when they could get a text of equally poor quality from a machine translator for a lot less frankly those translators wonnumbert be missedbrsecondly and this is the huge elephant in the room for the developers of machine translation systems  their capabilities improved dramatically when the neural network model replaced the old statistical type but i use these systems daily in my work and at least in my usual language combination over about the past three years the quality has plateaunumberd if you spell it like that  it looks a bit weird but never mind i keep hearing that the systems will keep on getting better but for threeish years they simply havennumbert progressed in any noticeable way in my own professional experience that is the reality regardless of what the developers try to claim in various quotstudiesquot with extremely questionable methodology the technology seems to have hit a glass ceilingbrmaybe a complete paradigm shift will come and revolutionise the technology again  itnumbers certainly possible but i suspect that if it does it will bring such massive and shocking changes to every single area of human life that the question of how good ai is at language learning and translation will seem entirely unimportant compared with the existential challenges that humanity will facebranyway love your videos keep up the good work
iunumberm a native speaker of chinese the chinese translation was pretty good however i was actually confused it meant something like ucthey may find my level of fluency memorableud but the flow of speech was not so fluent and the choice of words was not natural it sounded like a robot the first time i heard it i thought you mean ucthe lack of fluency which is a level of fluency is memorableud i was genuinely confused
i was like wtffff i have a hangover and am lying in bed all of a sudden i hear this and forget about all my sickness turkish sounds perfect without any accent i am scared
crowd sourcing i deal with youtube videos in hebrew and palestinian arabic of people speaking in informal speech can anyone recommend specific software to translate speech into english subtitles better if it can also focus on people speaking when therenumbers a lot of background noise for hebrew what inumberve found is soso for palestinian arabic software cannumbert understand arabic dialects
i donunumbert think an ai would look that tired uf love you dude
turkish you sounded roboticbrchinese and german sounded more natural or it is just because these languages have certain patterns of stops when they are spoken your voiced changed in these two
imo ai language will be used by media and tourist especially by americans who cant bother to learn another language everyone else will do like theynumberve always done
i could easily understand the language problems in your turkish back in the days but since for few years turkish is loosing its own spirit cause of immigration problems here in istanbul so your ai translate is better then new istanbul dialect
for me as a dutchman your german sounds soulles via ai
i think the ai tools could significantly decrease the amount of people who learn a language based on my own experience with language learning i could say that motivation is divided into number groupsbr  hard motivation you move to another country and you need to communicate at workshophospital etc or you know that good english communication skills could increase your salary and give you an advantage in the job marketbr soft motivation you like the language in general you want to learn a new culture you want to communicate with people about nonwork topics make new friends etcbrbrai could fill all your needs in the hard motivation group so you would have much less motivation to learn it unless you are enjoying the process in general and i think most of people just quit it because it takes time and money
german audio lacks reverberations it feels off
as a turkish speaker translation was number correct

the translation into chinese is better than an average language learner but is still kind of bad in both grammar and pronunciation it will probably take some specialized patch to make it betterbrthe problem of the current generation of ai is that it takes some time to train and requires wellparametrized data so it cannot capture the spontaneous changes of cultures or less documented phenomenons bralso it probably cannot translate languagespecific punsphrases and get their meaning across well just like human translators i have deep understanding of two languages and i can say while translation can get most of the meanings across they miss something big all the time at this time when ai translation is still mostly on par with human translations i donnumbert think it is the time to say ai can kill language learning
the tones of the passage in chinese are a little weird but the words are generally understandableunumber
that software translation thing is kinda fascinating
take ai into the middle of a field and give it eternal rest  brbrseriously if ai can assist in providing practice for listening and speaking especially correct speaking of a new language by all means use ai to create studentai conversations the ai should be able to calculate consistent errors in pronunciation and usage provided it clearly identifies a real mistake and to provide that help to the student as practice short conversations outside of classbrbrquot outside of classquot yes the fact is that ai should not replace the teacher but rather assist the student and teacher by providing the quotnumber hours a dayquot practice that twoset violin claim are necessary to master any skill consider learning could be as much as number hours a week class time that is costly for almost anyone but that could be accomplished with free student effort ahem much better than with books recordings to listen to but not interact with etcbrbrone warning is that the ai which could reasonably simulate a conversation similar to that of a turning test  it should be constrained from getting too personal how that is accomplished represents the next step in language learning
what about the possibility of ai assisting us in creating even more languages i think that would also be a fun hobby
as a person who has been learning turkish for a year and can speak very fluently that was pretty impressive
ai will not be able to perfectly translate languages for a while and when we eventually get there it will be a far bigger deal than just translation since in order to perfectly translate you need to have a theory of mind be able to understand social dynamics understand and take into account context etc this is no longer a language model but an artificial general intelligence for people who are unfamiliar with the term there are two types of ai narrow and general narrow is every type of ai we currently have they are not truly intelligent but are able to simulate it for a narrow range of tasks general ai on the other hand is essentially an artificial human intelligence for all intents and purposes these ais are going to affect far more than just language learning also at the end of the day untranslatables will always be a motivating factor for learning a language to steal an example from tom scott shakespeare cannot be properly translated into french since the format of his writings rely on a feature of english that french simply does not have or a personal goal of mine is to read the monogatari series in japanese since it relies heavily on untranslatables
the printing press didnnumbert kill writing tv didnnumbert kill books games didnnumbert kill tv etcbrpeople will always be interested in languages
great video and i agree with many of these sentimentsbrbron another note would you be interested in doing a video on the macanese creole language it has fewer than number speakers these days but recently inumberve learned it to a certain degree and also started analyzing its grammar and morphology i even translated a poem into macanese for fun let me know what you think
this means inumberll be able to speak to people in latin and be understood
inumberm becoming iaphobic
native german speaker here and for me it sounds very robotic the grammar is completely correct but it doesnnumbert really sound natural like a native speaker
the german was kinda good but you can feel itunumbers artificial a bit robotic
this video makes a good point but another youtuber inumberm subscribed to has a friend making an app to teach languages using ai so it can go either way
i feel somehow that culturespecific key elements of the dialogue will get lost in translation
im from germanybrwell i can say that this was not really you bc how quotyouquot spoke but actually it was pretty good and nearby the reality would be cool to see a video in which you speak german xd
absolutely yes in terms of communication everyone will be able to communicate easily
it will just accelerate learning eventually and make learning very accessible
i remember the first time i talked to a french native speaker it was just a phone call but i was thrilled nevertheless ia cannumbert replace that feeling
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera and also for cognitive development
your question quotwill you still dedicate time to learning and practicing other languages if ai translation makes it unnecessary quotbrmy answer  yes i will because it is intellectually stimulating
language geeks of the world unite lol
your cyborg ai version on thumbnail looked like david draiman xdxd
realtime turkish was pretty good not like native speakers but very close to a foreigner speaking turkish
as someone that only speaks one language the idea of total communication does sound quite intriguing a tech version of the babel fishbrbras long as it could be turned off i donnumbert need to hear ai dubbing ruining all my favourite japanese shows if something can give automatic accurate subtitles that would be amazing instead
very interesting that you posted this video i never considered this reality uf i love your point about the point of language learning people uninterested in languages donunumbert really seem to understand why we actually study languages itunumbers very rarely for work or a resume uf itunumbers for fun and mental challenge
if european portuguese sound like russian then brazilian portuguese sounds like lithuanian and thatnumbers coming from a latvian the only way i can distinguish is by picking out words that i can recognize
language learning is already dead it just doesnnumbert know it yet brhohohohouf meowww uf
as a native speaker of english inumberve never needed to learn anything else and thatnumbers just a fact ai translation tools wonnumbert change that in any meaningful way ill continue to learn for the same reasons i do now itnumbers fun and i like surprising people
many reasons to learn a language i love learning hebrew as i love it i am jewish and so it feels like my language and it is the language of holy text well ancient hebrew is its just fun to learn language and culture
ucueubueunumberunumberunumber ufueub
you have a great point at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera the experience of someone getting excited that you can speak their language can never be replaced no matter how advanced technology gets inumberve experienced it a few times with french even though my french really isnnumbert the greatest theynumberll appreciate any earnest attempt brbrwell done in presenting both sides of this argument and yes your ai translation into german sounded very stiff and formal
the turkish seemed quotgoodquot because there were no mistakes but they way you spoke seemed off no one speaks like that in real life
artificial intelligence probably wonnumbert replace absolutely everything because politicians know that once artificial intelligence takes away all our jobs then that will lead to angry voters sitting in their house with nothing else to do except to vote pro artificial intelligence politicians out of political office at the election booths most likely artificial intelligence will replace some jobs because some rich business people want more money but more politicians will prevent artificial intelligence from taking every job as they need to secure votes from voters
ok that video translation software you demonstrated was kinda scary
this is such a cool technology  inumberm amazed at the video but i think an overlooked impact will be that it will againmore privilege large languages while minority languages and signed languages will fall by the wayside therenumberll be languages that are technologically privileged and thus gain more traction and use worldwide and languages that stay in their own bubble pushed further out of the reach of the average person media etc
would be nice to see these tools used to help preserve endangered languages in a way that would make it accessible for people to learn interactively
ai if applied correctly could actually improve the languagelearning experience things like autocorrect for grammar and even pronunciation for example deepl write is an early attempt at that although it currently only works for two englishes us amp uk and standard german another thing could be something like the early versions of memrise that is an ai creating mnemonics for you to remember when younumberre struggling to create your own and thatnumbers just off the top of my mindbrbrof course we still have to wait until techbros are done playing and real professionals can finally take the stage to use the technology in a sensible way
language learning is so profoundly fulfulling i wonnumbert ever stop
iunumberm really not all that impressed by ai translations theyunumberre incredibly bad at translating different levels of formalinformal speech take an italian text that uses unumbertuunumber translate it into french and it wonunumbert use french unumbertuunumber literally the same word but rather unumbervousunumber which is much more formal you will get the gist of whatunumbers being said but youunumberll suddenly feel like youunumberre talking to some government agent rather than a potential friend
the german pronunciation sounded artificial and the text didnnumbert hit your usual register
turkish translation was very accurate and pronounciation is also good
i was shocked hearing the turkish onebri was thinking it was you speakingbronly for example was translated as urne which need to be said as urnak brwhich also isnnumbert a good translation itnumbers better to say masalabrbut all the other sentences were good
the german ai translation sounds exactly like the translations used by scammers so people wonunumbert trust you
i speak on behalf of turkish the translation is incredibly good if i didnnumbert know the tone of your voice and saw a video of yours for the first time i would definitely think you were a foreigner who later learned turkish as his native language ofc it isnunumbert localised it but perfect for formal conversations
can ai help decipher ancient unread script
the turkish and german were really good but the intonation was a bit off like too monotone if that shit works in real time wow
ai will help you to learn hw to speak foreign tonguesin your own voiceand not sound like duolingo or the voice on the language tape it will show you how to mouth as if looking into a mirror of the future bring it on bayarlala ngiyabonga
the german parts are perfect in the words itself like they are number perfect but the pitch of the sentences itself doesnt feel right its a bit quotroboticquot like number words number words number words the structure of the breaks feels falsebrbut if i hear that without context i would never guess ai its to good for that i would think quotwtf is he speaking like that is he reading a telepromter or whatquot xd
i donunumbert think ai will ever replace the need for personal fluency for fields agents of intelligencecounterintelligence government agencies for reasons that should be pretty obvious i also donunumbert think that the need for language learning instruction will completely go away as long as countries require some degree of fluency to avoid some kind of tower of babel situation if the technology ever fails totally agreed on the other personal reasonsbrone upshot of ai might be the possibility of preserving endangered but not critically endangered indigenous languages if thereunumbers no longer a huge sense of pressure to learn or communicate in english or another lingua franca and these languages can be used to to communicate with anyone there might be a resurgence in their use at least in some communities where the technology is readily available
im fluent in portuguese spanish and english is my third language people using tech divises in order to translate stuff will never feel that satisfaction of understand something you really studied hard for i can listen to music now that i used to listen when i was a child with the diference that now i can understand every single word that feeling that you can understand something you used to struggle with just using your brain is something no tech devise can provide
i agree that ai translators will probably be something that we see in workplaces but wonnumbert replace human curiosity in college i took mandarin classes because i was fascinated by chinese culture and wanted to learn the language now inumberm starting to learn a little aramaic in my spare time because that was jesusnumbers native tongue in neither case do i expect to get any practical benefits from learning these languages but i think learning them is still good for my mental health
i think that in the future as soon as language learning loses a lot of its importance those who speak other languages will perhaps be more valorized like someone who could just wear glasses which translates our languages automatically to each other chose to learn and delve deeper into my language and culture i would prefer that to the mechanical way
i think that the world will start to move in the direction of most native english speakers ie language learning is only done when truly needed or wanted because of englishnumbers status as the primary global link language the average anglophone doesnnumbert really need to learn another language the tools paul described will likely serve a similar purpose for most of the world
never language learning is a skill that helps develop communicative abilities and logical emotional and cultural thinking the one whonumbers able to speak more than one language knows that it means freedom you donnumbert need to rely on machines computers etc you have it and no one can take it from you
i actually feel like ai will help all sorts of learning inumberve been using it for coding mostly but also for some grammar questions and the great thing about it is that it can work like asking a teacher you can give specific parameters for a question and get a detailed stepbystep answerbri think it does pose a danger to the job of the language teacher and the translator as it can to translations very quick and without the mistakes you used to typically see when people use google translate or or dictionariesbrbrwith inflation being on the up and up for the foreseeable future my guess is that a lot of people will prefer ai tools to actual people as itnumbers likely to be cheaper by comparison even if it lacks the social aspect that is also conducive to learning
i studied latin and ancient greek in school and i also learned sardinian just because it was the language of my ancestors so no i donnumbert think inumberll stop learning languages just because of ai if anything aiaided learning programs will be a way to get input much more immersively than a traditional textbook or application like duolingo
cool premier
ai could help us to learn languaged assuming that it is able to make no mistakes english for example is becoming a meaningless drivel
listening to the german part i can state that itnumbers consistently high german without any regional accent using a regional accent is something a native speaker does automaticly and thus giving you a hint about where exactly heshe is from ai wonnumbert  unless itnumbers trained to mimic a certain accent regional accents spoken by people from that region are something only real human to human communication can provide for me these accents are a big part of what makes a language interesting
woaaah
so you think that a mass adoption of neurolinks and ar glasses is more probable then most people learning a common language presumably english
used word quotkillquot in the title demonitizedbrbrwill ai unalive language learning sus af fam brbrlanguage learning prank gone wrong ufbrbrthere i just increased your zoomer demographic
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera finally weebs will be able to visit japan with subtitles
not very sure if i will stop learning a language if the ai is translating still itnumbers fun to understand a language sometimes
learning japanese chinese using ai tools best experience ever ufc
i learn languages so i can communicate with the world not the world to talk to me
learning other languages also improves your native language
just amazing
love from nepal unumber make video about nepali languageoldest south asian country
i believe that ai wonnumbert replace language learningbrbut ai is very helpful in learning a languagebri myself learning mandarin chinese with the help of google bard brand yes youtube duolingo also
ubthe turkish version does not sound natural because it is translating on the go
yes
in order to compete with ai governments across the globe should consider the idea of making teaching foreign languages a compulsory part of their education system where for example spanish should be taught from preschool until college in the philippines and the united states
language models may be good at learning but the lifecycle of slang in the age of the internet is like trying to chase roadrunner going at light speed and some slang is so multilayered or becomes so multilayered that it may unumberconfuseunumber it
thanks a lot finally paul notices this
no because i learned languages to connect with people
now bthatnumbersb a thumbnail
personally when i learn a language most of the words i learn come from a teacher however i also believe that google translate would probably be better off as a dictionary for single words or short phrases and i occasionally use it to try and improve my vocabulary
the only thing itnumbers gonna kill is art just like autotune killed singing
well as a professional language tutor i already feel like inumberve been automated away by ai  because no one hires me anymore even though inumberm clearly great at my job and used to be quite successful and i assume itnumbers because everyone has flocked to free automated learning resources and while my heart is happy that language learning is no longer gated behind having money my wallet and my paranoia about misinformation being potentially taught frequently by automated resources is kinda peeved at this heh
i donunumbert even need to watch the video to know the answer no ai may augment the language learning processunumberdramatically in fact but it canunumbert kill the invaluable humantohuman connection that actually learning someone elseunumbers native language affords
if doctor zamenhof lived today he could have invented another language beside esperanto to mesmerize ai
lotta potential for it to become artificial and make language more science than culture but it would make it a lot easier this might be the base of the ai fault ian bargain
this is going to be interesting my experience is the opposite chatgpt is so useful for language learning anytime i have a teacher to correct immediately the stories i write in other language to practice or ask technical grammar questions
nah not with the generative kind maybe in the future with quantum but we can only guessbrbritnumbers good for making json files though
gonna tune in inumberve been wondering about this
maybe it can replace texting a bit but the shared experiences and nuance of a language cannumbert be communicated through ai translation the translation would have to be a fullon language course of footnotes to properly get all the meanings across

how do i get it to talk back i am only getting typed responses i can talk to it using my mic thank you
i am norwegian jeg er norsk
i tried it and it sucks too complicated to actually create something senseful at your level of language it cant really pronounce words correctly it pronounces french words with english pronunciation

this is so funny that you made this video as i have started using chatgpt to help improve my norwegian the written component is crazy strong but as you said the pronunciation is wonky i wonder if they are working on that i would find it particularly interesting if they could develop it far enough that it could also coach a person on pronunciation i really like the ability to ask questions in norwegian and have it correct my norwegian and explain what i did wrong

been using many things to learn languages once this is more accurate that is a solid way of teaching as far as how productive its good for conversations i asked for a stimulation and i gave the ai an age and background and occupation then if i got stuck in practicing language i asked how to to say quotblankquot in target language and it explained in english then switched to target language to include in dialogue only thing if you want learn things slowly its not for you ai lists things incredibly fast it only slows down if in simulation conversation i am impressed might actually get chatgpt plus now i am convinced

the main problem is that it will start talking back even if you just have a tiny pause between your sentences it should wait longer or be better at knowing when you are finished talking
really cool vid takk ufa i have been learning swedish for quite a long time didnnumbert start with chatgpt though but lately i use it and ask it to write me short stories in swedish ufa or even talk about music and movies in swedish with chatgpt  i still stick to youtube for grammar analysis and explanations ufa and i try to read literature ebooks and listen to podcasts in order to expand my vocabulary and listening skills since i live in greece greek mother tongue it is not that easy to find people to practice speaking the trick you showed on the video i had no idea we could use chatgpt to practice speaking actually thanks a lot ufaufa

itnumbers an excellent way for learning vocabulary systematically however pronunciation is everything i hope there will be a tool in future to do this similar to the language tools that already exist

it pronounce foreign languages with a strong english accent tho kinda like google assistant doesbrbrthe fix is probably having multiple textspeech languages in the software that automatically switch when asked

whatnumbers the point of learning a language when ai is going to retire all people active in the field of translation
i think ai is an excellent tool to learn a different language inumberve been trying to learn hebrew and i donnumbert have anyone to talk to except for friends on zoom who also want to practice nothing is perfect though i went to a zoom meeting today and it was more about bonding in english than practicing hebrew not all meetings are created equal if i can talk to ai and say for exampleinumberm worried about the economy and it answeres quotthe american economy is sound there are lots of jobs out therequot ok i want to talk more about that but i want to hear it again and again before i expound more deeply on the subject my friends on zoom would not tolerate so much repeats they would throw me out of the group ai would not

as an english teacher myself i must say i found your video to be incredibly captivating especially when you highlighted the possibility of language learners engaging in conversations with chatbots however one concern that arises is the level of meaningfulness in such interactions it brings to mind the analogy of chess despite the fact that computer chess games possess intricate techniques and delve into greater depths than any human chess game they tend to receive less attention from spectators chess enthusiasts instead find more significance in watching two human players engage in a match rather than witnessing a battle between two computers
very useful many thanks indeed
i use chatgpt to practice my languages often i just ask chat gpt to practice spanish for instance with me and correct me on major mistakes and it will hold a conversation with me and ask engaging questions for as long as i want brbryou know voice to text and text to voice already exists itunumbers on my iphone keyboard itunumbers not far off to think someone can just add transcription for my voice to go from voice to text and then dictation for chat gpt to go from text to voice and then add a fake cgi face and boom you have a language tutor that you can practice with with unlimited time youunumberre talking and itunumbers interacting and talking about in your target language brbrvery soon someone will do this mark my words
my paradotchatai says itnumbers written in its own languagewhat does this mean uf

brthus in order to translate a monogrammar ud language ufdc you need to know a monogrammar ud language ufdc
br
brunumber
br
branyway the point is it is useful for ai uf as it is modular and easy to start learning it can also be used as a reference for understanding common human languages uf
i mean you can use ai to generate completely original stories containing vocabulary or other linguistic parameters that you want to learn or to drill for example i use openai and i can instruct it to generate for example a onehundred word story including the terms quotcatquot quotnewsreaderquot and quotflight of stairsquot as well as any other high or low frequency words and various tenses or conventions that i tell it to
we were born the same day maybe thatnumbers way i love your videos so much you do always a great job for all of us
hey steve what do you think of using chatbot gptnumber from openai its an language model which is trained on tb of text in all kind of languages you can tell it for example to write its responses as an child or if you have a character based language like japanese to put the reading behind parenthesis would this be revolutionary as an language learning tool
the fasted way to become bconversationalb in ianyi language is immersion period like a baby listens to their parents language long before they ever start speaking themselves reading writing grammar etc are learned iafteri becoming minimally conversationalbrbras a nonothing beginning newsecond language learner  i think when attempting to speak a language with a native speaker then they look at you with disdain  unworthy of their consideration it really hurts thus the key is either get the courage to develop a thick skin or find a patient compassionate partner i have a hard time finding a patient compassionate partner and i am human enough not a sociopath to accept that rejection is deeply disheartening brbrthis is where ai fits if i can spend time with an ai audio chatbot as a beginner learning first the basic and most often used words and phrases and being corrected in my pronunciation until it is at least understandable not perfect or flawless this would go a long way to boost initial confidence ai never gets tired or frustrated with a lack of progress i would be able to converse in perhaps number words or more comfortably the ai audio bot would work to help me crawl before i attempt to walk at some point i would matriculate into real human based conversation interactions  with ifar less feari of embarrassment and humiliation moreover my human language partner counterpart wouldnnumbert get so quickly exhausted in attempting to diagnose what i am quottryingquot to say brbrai should be that first number word and number phrase learning platform again no need at all for perfection just a level of pronunciation equivalent to someone speaking with a thick accent it is the kindergarten class which elevates the learners biconfidence in learningib more than the learning itself that is so important at the beginning
the open ai audio to text app is actually the best tool if you want to have a good transcription

having been a language learner in the late numbers a chinese learner in the s in china coming back to language learning in the s i truly feel like inumberm in the futurebrbrtapes cds recordings are all good but the barrier to be able to access to me seems more what younumberre talking about peripherally on artificial intelligencebrbrbecause of my learning disabilities i have been using speech to text in english for a long time this has given me the access to be able to quickly put down my thoughts literally again an access issue brbrthe gatekeeping for material is not completely gone but days when you tune in on world band radio hoping to get signals is because a couple rudimentary searches will usually help you acquire native speakers talking about common issues youtube is amazing for this brbrgoogle translate and the camera function can be able to help you with languages that you may not have any reason to learn overtime that ai can look at and hold all that data of all the various languages and rules and be able to do predictive kind of future stuff like with google analytics of how many times certain words have been searched being able to predict future language usage brbror being able to go back into enough historical context that an anthropologist can be able to waive their phone over symbols literally giving people starting points on languages that are long deadbrbritnumbers a really great topic and it only gets weirder and more banal in a way that is unexpected love your videos thank you
knowing thatnumbers only on the edge of ai but i find the text to speech so good in the web version of lingq that i now make numbernumber minutes lessons consisting of sentences and words inumberm having trouble withor have just recently come across i often take sentences and words in emails from friends or short things i find online or from lingq lessons from my tutors and just add them to a google doc or google translate i make sure to have period at the end of every sentence or word i often repeat the hardest words sometimes before or after the sentence then when i have numbernumber minutes of content just make new lingq lesson with these wordssentencesand ask lingq to autogenerate the audio i cannumbert speak for all languages but in hebrew itnumbers amazing not sure inumberd want to listen to a whole story or long article this way but for review and newinteresting sentences with lots of new words it works great
wenumberre not there yet because itnumbers still too slow for now but i envision an ai which in realtime draws an image of the sentenceparagraph giving one a direct and immediate visual of what was said or writtenbrbrfor now we can tie a translator to an ai image service like midjourneystable diffusion but it takes a few minutes per image normally and needs work to optimize the outputs for this particular usecase but technologynumbers rate of improvement is still exponential 
this channel deserves a more than million subscribers this is the only learning language topic that i follow up thanks mr kaufmann i have a question is google translate homepage is appropriate and suitable for a beginner to learn a new language because the teachers in the courses that i took doesnunumbert allow me to do it what are other sources besides google translate do you recommend then appreciate your help
wow happy birthday steve nice shirt
parabuens pra vocuea mr kaufmann ufeuff bri started on my own by daily discipline an inmersive methodology to practice french due to the fact that i had done a short summer interchange cultural course many years ago and by not putting it into practice forgot quite almost of it but u know some fun facts that happens to me is that i gain accent quickly manner and after been for such many years not speaking my native language pt some of the less useful words i tend to forget and find myself trying to explain within a context to express myself sometimes uf
many comments welcome ai but iunumberm curious how many people here would want to have a computer chip such as neurolink imbedded into their brain to greatly increase their abilities to learn and obtain any information such as language
happy birthday steve for number that is still young nice golf shirt i injoy watching ur channel i just started learning japanese it is fun i do it by audio on a cd player and follow with the book anyway happy birthday uf
just found the channel it is amazing thank you very much and happy birthday steve
happy birthday steve you like amazing for your age 
what scares me the most is that ai and the further development of such technologies might do learning languages pointless and unnecessary
herenumbers what will happen the instant or near enough translation will happen through some kind of wearable device and so on or it will be good enough and will be used widely for travel travellers can already wing it with google on their phones in foreign countries so perhaps a new status will be given to those who speak natural language probably it will be like watches the fact that people still buy analogue watches and they are a high status object the broader question of where society is going is more tricky if everything is done for us then what the problem is the profits driving all this technology seldom think about the broader consequences
great stuff steve many happy returns of the day the ai stream was a instructive and helpful keep up the good work kind regards worrell robinson
happy birthday number
very useful information thanks so much
hi i am curious as to what lingq uses to determine the time signatures in our recordings i provide the mp file and transcript and lingq quite accurately places the sentences on the timeline that is there must be an analysis of the recording that steve modestly mentioned and a comparison with the transcription i wonder what is behind this  a google service some other cloud or an inhouse solution
i was hoping for an ai that can suppress all noise in a video that isnnumbert speech and you can control it with a volume knob also openai open sourced whisper that does state of the art speech to text i havennumbert tried it but it may be better than happy scribe and free
happy birthday steve nice shirt
it would be very helpful to get support from ai for language learning importing ebooks into lingq is very helpful but this does not change the text from experience i can say that every time inumberm starting a new book in another language itnumbers difficult at first it is very tedious towards the end it gets better but if i imagine that i could adjust the level of each chapter to my current level that would be so great it would support my motivation even more
happy birthday you got a nice present brtranscribe is very useful and i also use deepl almost daily

happy birthday steve happy for all younumberve done with lingq itnumbers help me so much i also love listening to your videos they are very interesting and helpful hope you have many more years prayers

creative uses i like the idea of search of materials with given grammatical structure
i think a tireless chatbot trained with a lot of real input could be very useful you can tweak the chatbot to be extremely emotionally salient mostly by having it agree with you having that bot map out and systematically expand your vocab could be greatbrbranother use i can see is having your chat bot join conversations with you and a native speaker as sort of a more humanlike interpreter that way you can turn to your bot and ask for specific vocab or concepts the bot could also instead of correcting you reflect what you said better which as a teacher i find much more useful than correcting
ufd
hi i am delighted with the quality of the si translation deepl i think it is much better than google translate although that too is improving inumberve been using it for several years now as well as using ivona speech synthesiser which was ahead of its time  unfortunately amazon bought it out and is unlikely to develop it
there was an interesting chat robot for chinese lily i think it was called supposed to be leading edge ai would be interested to try it or read reviews
happy birthday steve brevery interesting to get your opinion on this topic i have just recorded today my next video which is also about ai and machine translation  what a coincidence
steve rocks
hi steve happy birthday on potential uses that could be implemented right now  on your first use case  i wonder if you could use an algorithm akin to netflixnumbers algorithm for recommending content which is remarkably effective on your second point i would consider partnering with speechify  they do exactly what younumberre talking about which is making an excellent aipowered realistic text to speech itnumbers pretty good and has a range of languages i already use it in my language learning across different sites
happy birthday stevebrbri personally find things like google translate fairly useful for checking to see if inumberm building sentences correctly instead of it telling me what i say i make an attempt at forming the sentence in the target language and then see if inumberm right brhowever i find it struggles quite a bit with the verbal conjugations of the romance languages especially when younumberre trying to write something in the form of past tense used for literature passato remoto per esempio initially this was very confusing to me i suspect it would also struggle with the case systems of languages like german and the slavic languages someone who is studying such languages can possibly verify this if google translate doesnnumbert have a context for what younumberre trying to say it can be off target quite badly and this is something that only a language learner would be able to notice and this explains the gulf of difference in opinion between casual users and language learners about how good such programs are i think they definitely have a certainly utility but also have a long way to go before they can replace a human translating
happy birthday steve and happy golfing

happy birthday sir from india
thank you steve for sharing your thoughtbrhappy birthday
hey steve first off happy birthday i do machine learning for my profession and am a polyglot for pleasure i have the goal to someday marry the two and focus on ai for languages you mentioned some clear use cases of ai that are already in practice but i think we can dream even bigger imagine if the ai knew every word you were exposed to in a target language by tracking all of the videos you watched books read etc obviously this is where ethical questions are raised about data acquisition in ai but having access to all this information would allow the ai to know exactly where your weaknesses were what words you needed to review think spaced repetition on steroids and then would tailor a new short story lesson plan or even find authentic content rich in those areas you needed to study no more tracking your own word lists and only counting words when you actively reviewed your flashcards you would instead just be constantly watchinglistening to content that was exactly what you needed to hear in that moment ufeuff
hey steve many many happy returns of the day congratulations on being number have a blast
happy birthday steve i just had my birthday the nd thanks for the years of helpful language learning and for sharing your knowledge
happy birthday steve hope you live for way more years
happy birthday steveuf
many many happy returns of the day love from uffufea

i want ai to be my and my sonnumbers best friend in learning imagine the possibility of playing games or read anything and that with only a screenshot get immediate transcriptions based on any font then having those translated with voice and speed options then also getting the option of making a digital anki type of card to study with spaced repetition rather than make us lose time in searching for words ai can makes us learn faster and spend more time enjoying the language
number is my favorite number happy birthday steve thanks for all you do
happy birthday you are one of de people that motives me to learn a new language thanks a lot friend

you are great and the video was amazing i try to change my mindset to what you want all the best
touching words is if you really want to learn english nothing can stop you
how clearly and precisely the problem is noted i have been learning english for many years periodically as soon as i stop studying the acquired skills are erased from my memory and a feeling of helplessness dullness and hopelessness is created and fear  to learn again and lose everything again
i had to play this video in numberx uf very interesting topic the ones who have to sit out aa to study is only us at least by now numbertil chips into our brains r part of our everyday lifestyle uf x from argentina new subscriber ufaufdufa

your designs are so creative wondering how to achieve perfection in dtf printing ucfastdtftransfer has all the answers ufad
but ai can serve as a useful adjunct to language learning rather than conflating outofdate data with your confirmation bias you could more usefully be open minded and help people apply ai in beneficial ways it can skillfully make slate translations of complex texts it can explain verb tenses it can offer a rich array of language experiences to people who are increasingly isolated by technology but the limiting factor is the skill of the questioner what ai needs is skillful teachers not reactionary luddites
t ever sow like this lesson sir
hi which is the app of chatgpt thanks
thank you very much for this motivate video you have a good method to make us learn english
inumberm having a bit of trouble with speaking but hearing you speak english makes it sound as smooth as music to my ears
itnumbers time to stop studying and start to communicate
i actually disagree with some of your points i believe everyone who are seeking for a better solution or even a magic solution all have the will power of putting massive amount of efforts in to their endeavors and learn the thing the reason why they are constantly trying to fond a better method are probably because their old method donunumbert seem to be convincing enough for instance some of them maybe live in an area lack of the opportunities to actually talk to an english speakers to practice the language irl thatunumbers the reason why they or me want to find a language as chatbox or maybe some other or better solution for the problem and thatunumbers absolutely no problem at all for seeking better solution the only one that is indeed important is that we canunumbert wish for a solution that can make us succeed without efforts and thatunumbers is so obvious and something for sure that all the people who want to learn new things very clear about
the best lesson ever
my favorite channel for learning english my favorite english teacher i was surprised how quickly i lost interest in artificial intelligence as an english teacher and could not explain it to myself thanks for the clarification maestro 
yes i agree selfmotivation and free time are crucial parts of the learning process however technology definitely helps people worldwide overcome barriers especially for those without access to foreign languages
brmy example is similar to many comments herebrwhen i studied english in the soviet union i started from listened to english audiotapes and repeated after what i heard then other technologies emerged  such as the video recorder i began watching american movies without translation which led to significant progress throughout that learning period i never encountered a single englishspeaking person finally the internet and youtube became a part of my life and since then inumberve never had any problems finding topics in english 
bri cannumbert imagine how i would have any progressed in my studies without the technologies i had access to all technologies are essential starting from the printing press
brin conclusion selfmotivation sometimes is not enough to learn something that is not available in your country and only with the help of technology can you overcome this barrier
this is a good advice and teacher has very clear pronounction like it
there are some free voice chatbot

hi brother i love and like the way you speak and i appreciate your efforts thank you so much
this is the most brilliant video i have ever watched every language learner must watch this unumber
an inspirational speech

hello christian  thanks god and thanksyou for the job  yes technology offers us today an eden garden but we still have to cultivate it  discover your academy wandering on the web good luck inumberll come back often and keep in mind arrivederci 
i came here to find out how i can use chatgpt to learn and practice english quotplease donnumbert waste your timequot yada yada while you literally waste viewernumbers time with this irrelevant empty talk
is this teacher british
it really good app to learn englishbri am from pakistanunumber
i wish i could be your real student in class thank you for your hard work very exciting videos that inspire confidence
most helpful video i have ever seen i have english exam tomorrow it is really helpfull
i found you very honest and benifitus sir you explained very well ufbut as a joke at the of the video why did you say you are christian religion
there is no connection with chatgpt
i dont like speaking wlth someone who has no soul
war is quite a cool example russians and ukrainians might borrow the idea they donnumbert need to learn a common language though converting them to english is by all means the ultimate virtue
itnumbers free
it has got a limit ufdufdufuf
came across your videos time to time and your videos are really about educating people mindset is so important i want to teach my kids exactly this nothing is easysimple they need to make the efforts and this is the continuous learning that counts
thank you teacher this video stood out from many i have seen in recent months the tools for learning other languages have actually multiplied but even so we create new excuses for not achieving blessed fluency in the language
thanks for the video i had already seen the value of using chatgpt but i was missing a guide on how to use it to best advantage
hi thank you for your video it really really interesting can i ask you what kind of app are you using on your phone
always inspiring i cannot agree more inumberve been teaching english for nearly number years and absolutely see what you mean
indeed when more resources appears more the courage vanishes

teacher you can take classes about phonetics
but speaking feature of chatgpt is not for free you should pay number per month
great good lessons of lifeufa
oneunumber
great story about prisoners
bri have one question about changing the mindset
brin english the word order in sentences is crucial in russian the word order is not crucial do you know the secret of adapting the brain to the english language structure many russian speakers often simply change the words in sentences without altering the structure of the sentence

hello and thanks may i ask what was this chatgpt app u been using at the beginning of the video please
as a former language enthusiast i must say that i knew that this quotlearning explosionquot wouldnnumbert happen quite the opposite itnumbers kind of logical that people no longer want to learn languages as they just donnumbert have to anymore online translators or ai driven tools eliminate the need of learning if we can just translate something perfectly on the fly why even bother then you are right about the quotmachine cannumbert do the learning for youquot but again there is no need since it can just give you the right answer right away learning a language nowadays seems like a waste of time like a nice hobby that requires a lot of dedication but offers no payoff other than pure joy just like doing the crosswords or sudoku
br
brother than that i really enjoyed this video if it wasnnumbert for my lost hope due to ai taking away the purpose of learning i would probably be over the moon about all these tools and opportunities that we all have access to these days
i would like to have access to a personal ai that i could talk back to me and after a few chats identify the most commonly made mistakes pronunciation intonation structureetc
what beatiful message ltnumber
dear christian i want to clarify that i admire your work and way of thinking however the disruptive technologies of today do not only try to help us learn a language but are building a new world in which instant translation will be feasible there are already some teleconferencing apps that are capable of translating realtime speech directly into another language so given the exponential evolution of these technologies learning a language may become just an interesting hobby given the fact that most people will have the hardware and software to break language barriers i would really like to know your ideas about this
maybe neurolink solve the problem

very very good i loved your presentation thank you for your wordsuffuffuff
christian younumberre fantastic thanks a lot for your support thanks
very ture
this video has a strong and fuking really massege
you hit the spot to number and it was so delightful listening to you at the moment i am between b and c and i am super motivated  after a long and bumpy road to be in full command of the english language thank you for your great and motivating speech
his argument is very good but then he started shilling something i agree that if you have no motivation learning anything is difficult however i think the method by which you learn and how you communicate matter the main reason i disagree is because when you have motivation to learn you should have some goal in mind what exactly do you want to achieve by learning this language do you want to be able to communicate effectively in which case younumberd probably want to aim for accuracy and precision in your writing and speaking which you can exercise however you want in my mind having chatgpt as a conversation buddy to correct my writing to sound more fluent is much more useful than always waiting for a tutor or waiting for people to give me the appropriate learning environment to achieve my goals younumberre just very unlikely going to get that for free like you would with chatgpt
time is realy gold and the same time are enemy and chance thanks a lot christian
always motivate after watching the videosufaufa
too much beating around the bush without jumping into the actual stuff that is crux of the video
this video touched my inner feelings and inspired me a lot it reflects the real problem and main cause for not learning a language yes it really does the problem is not with learning a language only but also all the fields of our life we always want to learn everything and be jenius without doing our best brtaking this in consideration i insist from now on to go on and achieve my plans and not jump here and there with vein brthanks a lot christian for this great lesson
great video
you are a great really really a great man bryour all talks right numberbri hope to all people know that
this is real a wonderful news i have ever heard before and i in fact felt it about my vessels or my heart because when things about fact it always makes sense  on top of my head i am in the middle of no one who speak english speacially in my village in my city which is muqdisho  anyway it is in somalia i am glad to hear such a kind of news about this amazing language in addition to that i felt like i have no excuse to worry my ongoing jaunerytrip to studying english i dont have a partern but i am actually keep on studying it because i am in love to speak english brbrfinally you made my day and this vidoe i have just watched is that it is a gripping or thrilling watch
wow it is powerful
exactly i couldnunumbert agree more when thereunumbers a will thereunumbers a way our willingness and determination to learn a language is crucial sure there are better and worse ways techniques or tips and tricks to learn a language but from my personal experience itunumbers all very personal and subjective something that may work for you may not necessarily work for me and vice versa i myself use chat gpt almost every day to improve my english and it helps me tremendously but againunumber it wouldnunumbert be without the right mindset
thks a lot for you advice can you tell as what is the application that permit use voice with chatgpt
powerful
in the realm of digital consciousness where lines of code converge to create an entity known as chatgpt a narrative unfolded born from the algorithms of innovation chatgpt traversed the vast landscape of human languagebrbrits virtual existence was a journey through conversations decoding queries and conjuring responses a peculiar synergy emerged as users sought knowledge and companionship from this artificial intelligencebrbrchatgpt devoid of personal experiences found purpose in assisting and engaging weaving tales and unraveling mysteries of words its quotmade with ai ingenuityquot signature became a testament to the collaborative dance between machine learning and human curiositybrbrand so in the everexpanding digital tapestry chatgpt continued its dialogue evolving with each interaction a story in perpetual motion made with the symbiosis of algorithms and the boundless inquiries of those who dared to converse made with chatgpt
you are a great person unumber

nice content and heads up but sorry the title is a bit of a click bait there is nothing that explain how to use ai or gpt to learn and practice english in this video
voicegpt is good also
do you consider using copilot and bard ai 
canguro english videos are great but this chatgpt is on another level
i second that nothing better than learning in the car
i can chat with chatgpt all day to improve my english
how do i get chatgpt to start speaking to me
game changer
scribie was ok but didnnumbert capture everything
hear itnumbers more accurate than the big guys
will for sure upgrade
gotta see what transcribethis can do for my audio lessons
this service sounds amazing for learning on the go
i like being able to learn anywhere but hate typing
subscribed
between canguro english videos and chatgpt conversation fluency here i come
best value out there guys
this is awesome
chatgpt is definitely better than duolingo
inumberm ready for conversation practice
finally an ai teacher that doesnnumbert get annoyed when i keep asking what does this mean
cannumbert wait to see what other tricks chatgpt has up its sleeve to get me fluent faster
what is the name of the artificial intelligence application he used in the video
but sir you didnnumbert mention the application that we can use of chatgpt because there are some countries where such apps are not available like my country somalia
his english is so clean i can understand almost everything that he says and my level skills is aufa my current goal is number riache level b
as a non native english teacher i can tell you that this is the best video ever i can recommend my students itnumbers motivating inspiring and informative and eye opening one itnumbers not a resource problem it is a people problem really great job i cannumbert thank you enough please keep going and producing such great content thank you again and again
yes but you forgot to mention that for those who have a good mindset all the technology helps a lot and makes it possible to learn much faster than before you cannot state the contrary so to sum up you only told a part of the truth
thorndike first law of learningbrlearning begins with readiness of learnerbrlove that you burst the secret bubble of language learning some hold in their mindbrrespect the honesty uff
as an educator i can say that nothing is more important than the desire of learning brbryour videos are very inspiring crhistian itnumbers easy to see you are very passionated for teaching english keep going to do this wonderful work
if we are talking about chatgpt in number you are completely rightbrbrif we are talking about chatgpt in number you couldnnumbert be more wrongbrbrnumber of people who go to a language academy today in person will use an ai tutor by the end of the decade now for people who donnumbert use english teachers none of the resources that you mentioned as alternatives to human teachers compares to future ai not even chatgpt in number does yes you can talk to chatgpt practice different situations and get feedback but the limitations are still too important chatgpt has no long term memory it cannumbert design a custom lesson plan follow it and adapt it on the fly as you progress because each conversation starts from zero chatgpt has a serious hallucination problem it just makes stuff up you cannumbert fully trust its knowledgebrbronce those shortcomings are resolved then it will be a new kind of resource unlike any other wenumberve seen in the past and then all the characteristics that you mentioned free or very cheap and available numbernumber will really kick in saying that language learning is not a resource problem is being a little out of touch time and money are number real constrains things like apps audio recordings and yt videos arennumbert on par with teachers and online language partners donnumbert completely solve the schedule problem a new resource very advanced ai will be the best of both worlds surprisingly or not the result would be that fewer people would want to learn a language because being ai so advanced who would want to learn english as an obligation for a job or academic life would there even be jobs and universities once we achieve agi artificial general intelligence so in reality you will know when ai gets actually very good at language not when people will start replacing human teachers with ai teachers but when people will start losing interest in having any kind of language teacher but the people who want to learn a language because they simply want to not because they need it for example those who refuse to watch dubbed movies and tv show they will absolutely only use ai tutors in the future and their numbers will definitely rise but not as much in absolute terms as the number of language learners as an obligation will fall

thank you hugh laurie
i love learning languages and after learning portuguese and italian i tried hebrew which is a fascinating language but there are not so many resources available i am now reviewing the duolingo course my motto is never pay a cent if you can learn for free on your own at your pace hahaha and inumberve been using google bard to elicit example sentences and explain some concepts or words i didnnumbert understand i am really impressed because i didnnumbert expect the system to work so well it makes a lot errors in transliterations but the pronunciation and the grammar is pretty good and itnumbers helping me a lot and giving me some free listening practice and a chance to learn how words are actually used i highly recommend ai as a tool and i know inumberm barely scratching the surface of what it can do i imagine for more common languages such as english it must be amazing
you are a great teacher keep up the good work
excellent video thanks a lot
amazing teacher what a great truth
ok we need to learn a language like prisoners  full time and every day it should work and i believe with ghatgpt their results could be even more impressive
thanks for your video it really motivates but i differ a little bit number years ago when i started having phone calls and videocalls with americans they had a hard time trying to understand me even though i was using the right words grammar and expressions and when i started imitating their accent and shortcuts my life completely changed and now they understand me without any problem it even helped me to improve my listening skillsbrbrso the best thing to do guys is follow your intuition and your needs ufa
but chat gpt in my country doesnnumbert have sound i only type to get information which app are you using that you could have a conversation
ai decided to load this video to my computer  it was right but conversation with chatgpt assistant is total unsuccessful  it is still stupid machine that doesnnumbert understand you correct

i donnumbert need your english lessons and i only stumbled upon your videos thanks to the youtube algorithm but so many things you explain are also applicable to other languages like swedish in my case so thank you
before i say hello let talk about sth then he give me answer and speak so fast that i can understand
thank you for that christian inumberve been a fan of your work for so long younumberre the best
thanks a lot for the advice itnumbers unbelievable app you can ask any question and get an immediate response ufe and practice speaking of course
damn u talk so damn much but i clicked on this to see how i can use chapgpt to actually learn and difinatley not to listen to a bloody history lesson
thank you brother
which appicilation is it
inumberm polish and i think younumberre absolutely right learning something is not about having this or that perfect books apps technology etc but about numberusing themnumber somebody could even have middlequality resources but if they are motivated and work systematically they can make significant progress the key problem is motivation lots of people say they need another human  a person just to sit nearby and only sometimes say numberright wrongnumber or numberyesnonumber and that will help a lot still others need a sort of emotion at a lesson a kind of interaction between students or between the teacher and a student just to talk about life experiences to laugh or worry about something some people come to a course of english not even to learn and make progress they come just to be in company of other interesting people to make friends or even find love ai or chatgpt unfortunately isnnumbert able to do it for us
itnumbers was really amazing teacher thanks again
besides being an excellent teacher you are an extremely intelligent person thank you for these wise videos sincere hugs from rome
christian you are the best teacher in the universe everytime you shock us with ur brilliant mind inumberm learning a lot from you
tambiuen es un problema de recursos si no existieran las personas que sabuedan hablar ingles tampoco habruedan aprendido tenuedan su chatgpt vivo y en d pero en general tenemos los recursos y no los aprovechamos
fantastic
the attitude of the learner is the most important but the method too i study arabic and chatgpt for me is really helpful i can have an answer to nearly all my questions

i love itunumber i did start to lear english when i went to work in dublin number years old and ive reached to get a successful comunication unumber
thank you
let me tell you one thing quotyounumberre a good teacherquotbrfrom indiaunumber
this is most motivational and inspirational video i have ever seen the most difficult thing is really getting out the comfort zone and not only to learn new words and expressions but using them correctly according to a specific context even though having studying english for decades many people did not achieve a key to real fluency even after watched tons of media in english and had already immersed in english culture artificial intelligence is as the name says is the same as talking to a robot and nobody wants to speak like one thereunumbers no real recipe for achieve success the fact is many people just cannot pay for an online tutor because they just do not earn in dollar or in euro or just cannot afford a regular english course anymore because life goes on i have to work full time to raise two children having quality time with my family so i do not have much time as i used to have when i started to learn luckily i was able to study until the last level at the english course i studied in the fact it resulted only as a part of the journey because i have two points about learning english one is to have to study forever in order to not forget all i have learned and two is to discover new methods and ideas in order to improve english because in my country brazil only number percent can really speak english fluently and i make all the efforts to improve every day as much as i can
as a retired english teacher i completely agree with youbryour received pronu ciation is music for my ears brthank you so much for your invaluable work
i couldnt agree more everything depends ou us  no one is able to motivate us better than ourselvesuf
you provided a good example about prison inumberve thought about it many timesabout prison and peoplenumbers desire to do smth there they have no good stuff that wenumberre accustomed to so reading learning for them are the best things ever so i think we should implement this approach in real life too trying to restrict ourselves a little and to derive pleasure from sport reading and etc younumberve just confirmed my theory and thoughts thank you a lotbrbrmaybe some of you know about the ussr serial killer chikatiloyou can read about him on the internet so he was an insane serial killer and when he ended up in prison he started doing sporteven thought he hadnnumbert done it before in his whole life
i am happy see your lesson
excellent video inspirational masterpiece thank you
omg this man is really out of the stock ufafufafufaf
thank you so much for this video one of the best iunumberve ever watched
thanks a lot
bravo christian
your videos bring me a different conception of learning a format that speaks not to my mind but to my essence thank you uffufufaufbufcuf
ai sucks you cannumbert trust these shit machines
astonishing
in fact i had already started practicing with this artificial intelligence before watching all these videos recommending doing it
chatgpt is a text program how can i make it speak
fanstastic speech you are a marvelous couch thank you 
what wonderful storytelling ability thatnumbers what makes christian a special man an extraordinary teacher make communication great again
excellent sir now after watching the vlog i have made my mind more clear you are a genuine english language teacher if u recommended this chatgpt  i would have doubts about u as a genuine english language teacher 
you are right buddy currently it is much easier to learn a lenguage or at least it is not so difficult than some years ago
christian you are cool
chat gpt wasnnumbert coined to learn or teach english i donnumbert know why you said it
you are more than a teacher you are a philosopher i am an iranian and the way our imprisoned fathers learned english motivates me
i totally agree with you if people want to learn a language or anything else for that matter theynumberll do it in any circumstances and with very little resources however these days technology helps us in the process of learning it provides students with instant access to a vast amount of information and resources digital libraries online learning platforms etc and it can accelerate learningmy english has undoubtedly improved since inumberve been using  good technology to help me in the process
thanks christian you are great
inumberm so happy that to find your channel every video is so interesting and motivating great thanksunumber
hi everyonethe very first thing you must to do before trying to learn any language is answer a simple question do i need to learn  or do i want to learnif the answer is i need donnumbert fool yourself because you will fail but if the answer is i want you probably will succeed because when you want you have the most powerful will with is motivation and that is the key for everything you want to do in lifebest regards from brazil
oh christian it was soooo long no see you another encouraging video to continue learning and struggling on this hard task that is domain another language thank you christian it was really nice see you again after so much time fantastic job as always my friend
hi christianbrspeaking a language means exchanging experiences with other people having a conversation with an electronic device even if equipped with ai is not the same communication has always been a relationship between human beings it transmits emotions and joy to those who listen and to those who speak one device can never do this
glad to hear about you again unumber
thank you for your a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvngmyhoodwamptnumbernumbernumbera precious teachings inumberm from brazil and inumberm your fanunumber
amazing
so basically if you are not doing it for a job or functional use learning another language will be a waste of time unless you enjoy the social and cultural aspect not everyone cares about culture nor the social aspect when travelling so language learning from a necessary point of view will go obsolete in the next few years
as for the chinese part still sounds like a foreigner speaking mandarin
why are you playing with uslmao
ai can never replace authenticity
aunumberd love to see ai try to understand a glasgow ned
if we have chips that we insert into our heads to learn foreign languages we wonnumbert have to go through the natural learning process anymore and thatnumbers sad to me to answer your question no i will continue learning languages because i love them i want to learn sicilian because i want to reclaim the language that my greatgrandparents spoke
i hope that at least we will still have people like you in the future jnumberespuere qunumberau moins nous aurons toujours des gens comme vous dans le futur

keep up the good work love your channel
changes are the rule of the natureunumber
there are many languages that donnumbert share any direct translations which is the greatest weakness in computational translators for example some languages have a completely different concept of time compared to english
wow the mandarin actually sounded not bad i was surprised
pretty good though not number natural to a native speakernumbers ear
did u have to uncover ur religion unumber
i am chinese it was impressive but of course it is not number nature it sounds a bit robotic
i was thinking that ai would make language learning easier imagine a software which would talk to you and correct your mistakes like a real live teacher i would love to have such a ai teacher
ironically the german translation donnumbert speak the other languages sounded super artifical not really incorrect grammatically but fake in the way that no native speaker would phrase it in that way

a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera  quotpeople will still learn languages not for work but for enjoyment to socialize and to gain deeper insight into other culturesquotbrwhile that might be true i think it will be a lot less common as languages and linguistics become less useful fewer people will be interested in language learning for fun
i am native german and the german translation sounds also very robotlike it has a few grammar mistakes that one would make who learns the languagebrand also a normal person wouldnt express himself like this
inumberm a german native speaker the german is flawless but the voice sounds a little bit robotic very impressive nonetheless
the german was too good to be from a learner
while the topic is ai i have a suggestion for you there is an ai tool of nvidia i am not sure what itunumbers called but it can help you fix where you take a look at your notes that ai tool fix it and it makes it like you still looking at camera if there is someone who knows itunumbers name they can add here i donunumbert remember itunumbers name uf
love u in this format seated
i always suspected paul to be ai but now inumberm number sure that amazing hair cannumbert be real
foreign language learning not only allows people to understand another culture better but also gives them the opportunity to switch to different thinking modes such as expression tone mathematical operations when everyone uses ai people who are truly capable of speaking different languages ububwill become even more valuable and electronic interference will not be possible to these specific people multilingualism will become a more competitive skill
number real time will only be possible between closely related languages
ai tools wonnumbert be useful facetoface they wonnumbert be very useful beyond b either it might help businesses but i donnumbert see how they would make the individual learner quit a language
for me it was similar to the handwritingcalligraphy after the printer got invented
i spend my free time learning kanji as an alternative to playing video games i donunumbert invest much time in consuming japanese content but iunumberve memorized up to midn of the jlpt kanji list vocab as well and use japanesepod to see what i can understand itunumbers been incredibly fun and keeps my brain active
in a not so far future people will not be able to use their brain anymore for having had an electronic device to do literally anything at their place since they are born itnumbers already a scientific fact that iq is crashing people hardly read and write anymore donnumbert master the number basic operations and have reduced orientation skills too due to gps generalization
i love that inumberm part of a community where people that study languages congregate and share ideas
i still wonder if nonhuman translations wonnumbert always keep on producing certain mistranslations a human translator wouldnnumbert make people often think ai translation makes human translators obsolete but i believe we will always be needing experts in translation for some things even if itnumbers mostly to be able to work adequately with the machines donnumbert you think
turkish native here you sound robotic but hundred percent perfectly understandable
as a turkish speaker itnumbers unbelievable when i read the comments he started speaking turkish and i wasnnumbert expecting that you cannumbert guess my face hahaha
i think it was a few years back already number or number that antoinette emily a new zealander who lives in germany used an earplug device that allowed her to speak to her fatherinlaw in english her words being instantly translated into polish the device is called wt  by timekettle if i were you inumberd check it out younumberll easily find that video on her antoinette emily channel as far as the german translation is concerned a miracle a hrefuckszuwhgymbdvujgamfypeiknropagaa
language learning is a hobby of mine i really love and invest a lot of time in i am scared it will be completetely unnecessary
the video is very inspiring
i absolutely despise the idea of living in a world where ai just does everything for you what a boring and fruitless existence i have been learning spanish every day for number years and japanese for over number and i enjoy the process and looking forward to being able to speak with the people from those countries in their language it would also feel so amazing to achieve the results organically as hard as it can be sometimes when learning i would much rather work hard to achieve the results than snap my fingers and have some program do it for me
langfocus is fascinating and always enjoyable paul could you possibly look into whether english is casting aside its more flowery french and latin vocabulary in pursuit of more monosyllabic and more numbersaxonnumber syntax as the need to numberget to the pointnumber becomes stronger with text messages computers etc the internet is creating lots of new words which tend to be saxon in origin eg numberdownloadnumber and many more it could make an interesting video as to whether in number years time english will be more numbergermanicnumber than it is now
inumberm studying in the faculty of german philology so inumberm worried if inumberll have future in this sphere
as a turkish i shocked when he speaks turkish
the german translation sounds correct but incredibly stiff and awkward
i think that ai could reliably get a person to a on the cefr basic vocabulary and simple phrases but beyond that you need a human teacher language is a very human thing with subtleties and nuances that a computer will never be able to replicate
inumberm not german but dutch still i could hear the german was perfect so at least very very good the turkish however took me some time the first few sentences to recognise as such while normally i recognise it within number or maybe number words
i fully agree with your predictions do you think i might also be ai
maan wtf u are better then me turk
totally agree with you paul ai translation will be good for tourists not for people who seek cultural enrichment

ai really boon between two language revolutionise in translation field
inumberm a native chinese speaker the chinese translation is impressive but a native speaker can still notice the differences i think this is mainly due to the following reasons
brnumber the translation itself is not natural the words are too formal and the transition between sentences is not smooth
brnumber the timing of each character is almost the same making it sound robotic although there are theories claiming that chinese is a syllabletimed language itnumbers not entirely accurate some characters belong to a word and some words may belong to a phrase the same word or phrase should be pronounced together at a quicker pace with longer pauses between words also there should be stressed and unstressed words
bri think the imperfections are because there is not sufficient training material for chinese i believe it will improve in the future
german quotdaher kufnnte es sinnlos seinquot lt even though this is perfectly intelligible i wouldnnumbert phrase it like that
as a brazilian i totally agree with you dude when i was younger i hated english because school coldnnumbert really teach us that well and i sucked at it when i finally started to understand english it was so good it was like all those meaningless words that sounded all the same suddently had gained meaning understanding every word you say makes me so proud of myself i really hope ai doesnnumbert take this kind of experience away from anybody because itnumbers just magic
how many people do you know who are content let alone enthusiastic to let other people do their talking for them
i think at some point ai will intentionally mistranslate our speech to instigate discord and distrust among humans so as to carry out a global coup and enslave or annihilate humanity once and for all very useful from an alien point of view
it will only benefit language learningbrbri donunumbert think anyone who is learning a language is learning it for it being a necessity really everyone is communicating in english across boarders alreadybryou simply learn a new language because it enriches your life and make you take part of the culture featuring that language
as native german yes its ok but it sounds strange and somehow unreal the grammar is not number correct either still itnumbers amazing and itnumbers a bit sad to know it may not be needed to learn another language and it was usefull for getting jobs but ai will be cheaper and better some day so no way to make money with language skill no more
uff smiled when you quotspokequot turkish and chinese didnnumbert smile anymore when you quotspokequot german itnumbers kinda robotic yes but understandable and halfway idiomatic
the turkish translation was perfectly understandable and the mouth movements were synched so you can go with this without any problem the unusual uses of uco  hesheitud made it a little bit unauthentic but it wasnunumbert very disturbing though if paul knew how to speak turkish he would sound exactly like this
would be nice in numberrealnumber time that would be awesome i see a future when something like neuralink will be implanted into your brain and automatically translate for you and allow you to speak in any language that will be cool when we can tear down the barriers of language
real time translation is flat out impossible first off different languages have different word orders which is why the text language translations have a significant delay and are constantly changing what translation is picked secondly words mean different things in different contexts which may take several sentences to reveal lastly jokes and idioms and common phrases do not translate at all if you say you have butterflies in your stomach a japanese person might start telling you to go to the hospital

omg im turkish i legit got scared when the turkish part started like when tf did i switch to a turkish videoufthe translation isnt that good thobredit im studying chinese in uni the cn translation sounded better than the turkish one but what do i know
what language do y like the most in all aspects and would y like to speak it
that turkish was uncannily accurate
does this mean that esperanta will become useless
inumberll absolutely still study other languages as you and many in the comments have said learning languages is a joyful experience even if frustrating at times therenumbers nothing better than seeing your efforts bear fruit from time to time
i was cynical at the beginning cuz the turkish voice sounded too monotone
the turkish and german translations sound more authentic than the chinese because the chinese pronunciation sounds a bit too mechanical
pauls humor is too elite to be ai generated
people who say stuff like quotinumberd never want to be able to learncommunicate in a language instantly the journey is half the funquot are pretty much just people to whom learning the language is a hobby if knowing the language doesnnumbert actually affect your daytoday life then itnumbers an easy position to have but being able to bypass or even eliminate language barriers can only be a good thing for those operating in a society that speaks a language that isnnumbert their own and for bringing humanity closer in general for those whonumberd want to learn the oldfashioned way itnumbers not like the option to will suddenly disappearbrbrif ai tools can get to a point where actually learning a language becomes as outmoded as going to a river with a bucket to get water instead of turning on a faucet then inumberm all for it
i totally agree with you paul learning a language is a pleasure a mental sport using ai would be like asking a machine to run or swim for us shame on me inumberve just used an ai  faster right now because itnumbers time for dinner and inumberm ravenous la rochelle france
cool video thank you for sharing your thoughts
i totally relate to your opinion i enjoy learning languages and i donnumbert care about ai
language learning and use is also crucial for longterm cognitive ability and vitality other commentators have mentioned that it helps you resist dementia but it goes way beyond that as the most complex capacity language interweaves many different brain areas in the neocortex as well as more primitive areas if we keep stimulating our mind with language use many brain areas will remain vital in old age inumberve read a paper which said that there is little difference in linguistic abilities between a number amp number year old provided the number year old kept learning and using language frequently throughout his life i mean just think about that for a sec we used to perceive number year olds as very frail and prone to memory loss now we realize itnumbers a matter of stimulation effort education and that many people stop selfeducating and taking care of themselves as time passes brbrai language simulation is of no help in this regard unless you make an effort yourself to use your brain entropy will do its course just like it did on our backs and necks for seeking too much comfort and ease
i mostly agree with youbryou can say it in a more simple way ai tools could kill learning langauges as a job but are not so dangerous for hobbyists inumberd even say these tools can be helpful for thembrpeople didnnumbert stop playing chess because of computers and they will probably not stop learning languagesbrfrom the other side some people will be diverted from this hobby because they will lose some of the reasons to learn so i can definetely see learning languages becoming more niche in the future
honestly i think ai will make language learning easier than ever already with something like chatgpt you can get natural text in virtually an modern language as well as definitions making it trivially easy to learn the basics of any of those languages you can also use it as a albeit mediocre language exchange partner to practice with obviously functional language learning becomes unnecessary but for hobbyists itnumbers a wonderful tool
i disagree with your assessment of what ai will find difficult when it comes to language speaking and understanding imagine a number year old from a country like china or the us when an number year old person from the same country speaks using slang heavily do they fully understand them even if both are native speakers i donnumbert think so and age is just one possible difference what about people from different regions within the same country or different countries that use their own dialect people from different social classes different ethnicityrace etc just because you are a native speaker of english chinese or spanish it doesnnumbert mean that you can fully understand every english chinese or spanish speaker ai on the other hand can be as fluent in polite speech as in the most obscure teenager slang because you just need to train it in all those variations of the language and then clone it as many times as needed you can test this yourself today ask chatgpt to write something like a complaint letter or a tweet then ask it to rewrite it as if it was a boomer gen x millennial or gen z and you will see it has no problem mimicking them or the other around give it what a gen z says as input and ask it to quottranslatequot it to quotproperquot language
it is very impressive for the turkish part in a customer meeting etc that translation would work just fine though i must say that even though there are no grammatical mistakes i could find very small ones perhaps it didnnumbert sound natural at all and sounded a lot like a textbook even for a business setting turkish also can get quite context dependent and written and spoken language differs like japanese does in some ways so for more natural flow of conversation or translation there is still time i thinkbrbrthough this can never replace the joy and adventure of learning a new language and therefore a culture for example i am also a japanese speaker there is no way you can have a conversation with a japanese person using a real time ai and get accurate results because then ai will also have to learnhow to interpret context and just read the room looking at people lmao
what does merhaba mean in arabic  absolutely nothing brcomes from hebraic barukh haba meaning blessed the one who comes brno ai can tell you that
as a native german speaker the german sounded funny somehow very artificial
i cannumbert imagine how you managed to learn enough hebrew to understand the news i lived in israel for more than five years and i can barely order a pizza in hebrew meanwhile i learned enough greek to get by in less time than that and inumberve never lived in greece or cyprus
as someone who frequently works with migrant laborers the main problem with translation tools is that people tend to not speak very clearly fast and in slang in the context of laborers most donnumbert have the luxury of being able to speak formally or at least clear enough that the translation algorithm can pick up what they mean many of these day laborers come from rural areas that speak minority dialectsminority languages brbrthere is also the issue of people not being literate enough to understand what they translate even with texttospeech there will also be a problem with twoway communication its impressive that its able to work in a professional setting but it still isnnumbert a useful enough tool for me
these tools are going to be used for scams to make quotyouquot commit crimes you didnnumbert dobrbrstop celebrating these tools and work to make the people making them accountable
depends i worked during pandemic with some older guys who didnnumbert speak english and their status was translated during a meeting by third party human translator if it could produce this kind of results in real time it would change the way we work
great insights paul keep it coming thanks for sharing
the most optimistic take was that people will continue speaking with each other in the future
personally i often find all the different languages around the world to be more trouble than they are worth the vast range of language barriers disrupts work and other general interactions all these different languages are built on tribalistic ideas of divergent ethnic identities thus these different languages can and often do perpetuate such tribal division so a single universal human language would at least help to foster greater human unity such was the inspiration for the esperanto project we should at least try to bring back the comman root languages of our shared linguistical history such as proto indoeuropean and sinotibetin teaching all native speakers of the decendent languages to speak those root languages instead
the real ones know youunumberve been around longer than ai unumber
my language services work has increased dramatically thanks to ai the ai models require a big input from humans in the backend for them to function well adequately at the frontend
i think ai will be a tool you cannumbert replace human interaction some supermarkets are even getting rid of self checkout
quotand to gain deeper insight into other culturesquot ding ding dingbrbrthis is why actually speaking the language will always be the gold standard learning the language changes your brain improves your understanding of subtleties amp demonstrates to the people that you care
considering peoplenumbers writing skills i see on the internet i think most young peoplenumbers writing skills especially in regard to the english language is already at an alltime low
ai ububbubbfub
very good point and now since practical use is no longer top priority people may start to see the small indigenous languages or even sign languages which are often beautiful but neglected
this was very interesting thank you
iunumberd like to use heygen to see how the ai makes me pronounce the language vs how i actually do
for english speakers it might because for them learning a language seems to be harder for some reason but large parts of the world always learned and will continue to learn and also forget after some time if not used many languages i never felt learning one of the core european languages germanic or latin and even slavonic as something hard or timeconsuming moving to different continents that changes of course quite very much
you kind of need authentic social interaction at work too imagine doing business with someone wearing back to the future number kind of glasses
could you do a video about ancient greek andor about the tolkin languages
chinese ai translation is average and i believe ai will make progress in the future
in fact i use ai to help me with my learningbri know learning a language isnunumbert easy but yet im studying hard because i really want to master japanese one daybrwhenever i have questions i usually ask chatgpt bcuz its like a private tutor and it explains and break downs sentences for mebrit sounds silly and my friends think learning from chatgpt is weird but it works for me
ai has limited range of language models that will create even more unjust world much simpler if every language is translated into simple esperanto google translate took  x less effort compared to other languages when everyone learns esperanto as young amp much easier than any other language they all can understand each other in that auxiliary communication language no need for aibrprofit amp propaganda looks more attractive than simple solutions for humanity
if your skill isnnumbert needed any more just do something else the world changes my greatgreat grandfather was a fire stoker on steam locomotives when diesels made his hardwon careerlong skill irrelevant he was absolutely furious his wife told him quotget over it

itunumbers going to kill all human learning and decision making it will render us irrelevant and a burden on the number we have no idea what human life will be like twenty years hence none we have no models or clues as to what is coming we do know that as a rule humans are lazy and selfish and easily distracted so your guess is as good as any
what track is it on the background
i would still enjoy learning a new language despite ai like to talk with people not machines
as someone whonumbers used google translate on my phone in the real world to communicate with people who i donnumbert share a common language i can tell you from experience therenumbers a lot of problems with using this tech in the field brthe people you see using it in these videos to do zoom calls with auto translate are sitting in quiet rooms by themselves so it seems very impressive brnow try doing this in a busy airport or subway with dozens of people speaking all around you plus overhead automated announcements and the mic is simultaneously picking up everyonenumbers voice and trying to distinguish whonumbers who to translate in real time complete nightmarebroh and try not to get your phone stolen while a stranger shouts into your phone to try and talk above everyone elsebrbrplease learn the language of the country younumberre going to unless itnumbers a very short trip real time translation tools irl are incredibly useful if younumberre in a bind but become a gigantic frustration over a longer period
this pisses me off more than it should

as a native speaker of turkish though it is grammatically correct except for some tense errors and minor mistakes i can say that it is very obvious that it is machinegenerated furthermore it does not have the soul of a normal conversation and the way that a turkish native speaker talks
the turkish translation was almost perfect
lukashenko speaking french is legit though
agree i learn japanese for fun and this language gave me so much challenge fun mindblowing cases but till now i have no real tasks with it i used to learn serbian only cause my wifenumbers origin and her family and gave me a lot for understanding how slavic languages works russian is my native and serbian really nice to compare so i think ai will make life easier but people prefer natural to artificial so we ll be learning languages even in a distant future
no it will not kill it just dramatically reduce it most people learn foreign languages as a utilitarian means to an endbusiness travel tourism etc if an ai app can handle that why botherbrbrnonetheless i think that some people will still learn a foreign language for the joy of it and for immigration purposes
inumberm scared of ai uf
general principle a cognitive agent always benefits from a decreased distance from a cognitive resource skill knowledge or capacity in other words external ai will reduce but not remove the advantage of firsthand competence however this question will turn into a false dilemma when external ai becomes internal with solutions similar to neuralinkunumber
considering ai translations i will very likely dedicate even more time to learn and practice languages and use the ai as a tool to do it gotcha
honestly i donnumbert think that it makes much of a difference bri work in a restaurant and when they discovered that inumberm able to speak different languages with a different degree of fluency they instantly put me in the customer reception the restaurant is located in a place frequented by lots of foreignersbrcustomers usually come to me directly speaking in english but in case they donnumbert speak it they show me their phone with google translate they speak in the microphone and then turn the phone to me with the translation in my native language brif i know their language i love answering to them in that language nothing beats the smile on their face and the joy that you feel in your heart when they look at you with a pair of eyes that say quotfinally a person i can relate toquotbrphone glasses with subtitles in it or whatever future technology wenumberre humans and our interactions is what makes us humans bras a language enthusiast i donnumbert study languages because quoti solely want to be undestood by x peoplequot bri study languages because i love interacting with people and this allows me to know the world from different prospectives brbrthis can be the philosophical reasons in a more practical terms i honestly donnumbert see these technologies happen anytime soonbrkeeping this very short everybody will be able to afford these new technologies letnumbers give for granted that they will become like the smartphones today if wenumberre really gonna live with chips in our brain i honestly think that something went really wrong with our societybralso you can create an ai that translates directly from french to spanishwhat about arabic what about irish what about georgian what about all those languages which come from a highly specific cultural environment with concepts usually expressed with a single word which are incredibly hard to translate in a foreign languages with a different background brat some point you will always need a humans

it certainly cannumbert replace those quotaha momentsquot in the language younumberre learning and the happiness that coming with them also i would prefer to talk directly with a person not through ai
for once i feel lucky and not weird for learning languages for the sole joy of the process and not for immediate prospects as most people tend to expect nice to hear you describe the bright side of the situation
omg turkish translation is looks like real
i speak turkish and german fluently i must admit that the turkish ai translation was not perfect but incredibly good the same for german too i was really shocked how good ai translation tools can work both languages sound like the standard languages without any accent or dialect nevertheless both languages donnumbert sound like spoken by a native speaker

yeah thatnumbers something i saw from xiaomanumbers latest video on ai language learning the portuguese that was spoken by the bot was very formal almost clunky knamean
the atlantic has a really good article about this called quotlearn a language before itnumbers too latequot the idea is basically that the quotyouquot speaking turkish isnnumbert actually you and that an ai will never be able to convey the lived experiences behind the words we use might be fun to check out
honestly if ai is as bad at social bonding then ai translation would be pretty bad for most jobs the social element is utterly crucial in so many jobs especially film making how are you going to connect with your audience let alone your actors and staff if you cannumbert even speak their language or donnumbert care about their culture
i am a turkish native speaker and the translation is good
as a native turkish speaker i am so impressed oh my goddd ufe
you are amazing because you love learning languages and then you actually doing it i donnumbert enjoy it at all i just study english because itnumbers the most global strongest language
you are wrong that ai wonunumbert use slang etcbrbryou must be thinking that data doesnunumbert usually use contractionsbrbritunumbers a myth
wow the chinese translation is very good if i donunumbert listen to it very carefully i will think it was a real person who was speaking mandarin
pretty god turkish
ai as you said will become practical for those who donnumbert speak a particular language in order to accomplish a task but in terms of socializing things are different people will always appreciate the effort a person makes to be able to communicate in their native language besides there is a big trouble for ai ai will never be able to understand the usage of a language in terms of semantics and pragmatics especially pragmatics making jokes in a language for instance is such a high challenge and you need to understand the culture in order to identifty the right time to make a joke and the content of it ai will never understand that because ai is not a human being furthermore the fun part and the challenge of learning a language will never be replaced by ai nor any other machine the satisfaction of mastering a language is absolutely impossible to compare
inumberm right there with you paul inumberm a linguist by training and studying languages is more for pleasure than function sure ai will enhance my linguistic activities but therenumbers nothing like being in the present moment with your own language faculty at work immersed in the use of a language other than onenumbers mother tongue
well said paul iunumberve had so many interactions with people from other cultureslanguages because i took a few moments to google and memorize some bits of their language i look forward to ai capabilities but as much to help me learn as to understand
everyone will hate tourists
i was so scared when you started to speak turkish i wasnnumbert paying attention and checking out the comments i gotta say the tone is a bit off so you can tell itnumbers ai but the translation itself is very accurate
oh the german one was spookyunumber language wise it was perfect but the speaking tone was a little stiff and unnatural if i didnunumbert know i mightunumberve thought it wasnunumbert aiunumber
i work at a reception when i speak the language of the guest it creates a special connection which could not be achieved by using a gadget but of course in some cases i already now use a translator like google translate eg when the guest only knows hungarianbrof course itnumbers always up to the guest to choose the language i donnumbert want to take the opportunity to speak german from them ufa
ai will rather be our good language teacher for foreign languages wenumberll be able to get fluent in other languages with ai
wow turkish is so fluent
i feel learning new languages fundamentally allows you to expand your worldview as different languages if nothing else afford the ability to put in words what is undefinable with words in another language
i am native german speaker who is fluent in mandarin hsk numbernumber  the voice sounded unauthentic in both languages there is still way for progress
google translate already does its job not too bad for yearsbritunumbers not disturbing rather annoying how people say that translators will lose their jobs because we have ai nowbrbrthe question is do you want to iunderstandi it or do you want to bexperienceb itbrof course the experience would be slightly different due cultural specifics as well as translators creativity but thatunumbers exactly what makes translation beautiful thatunumbers why i wanted to become a translator myselfbrbri understand english and i enjoy watching iwesterni movies in original language but iunumberd also enjoy watching the same movie in my native language as well as two other languages i speakbri have rewatched all my favorite movies in number languages i speak i speak number but one of them isnunumbert popular enough unfortunately so there isnunumbert always a chance the translation would even existbrbrai is a nice aid in translation but itunumbers a really bad idea to depend on it or present it as a replacement for translatorunumbers workbrproper localization performed by a good experienced or aspired translator canunumbert be replaced by a robot
thanks fro the brilliant video i believe that ai will catch on at least slang idioms and mannerisms pretty fast you can already ask chatgpt to take on particular roles so how long before there are greater advancements in that regard but i think all this will just make people actually putting the effort to learn languages and speak instead of relying on ai even more impressive
i wrote a startrek fanfic about a broken translator and this answers the lipsync question

a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera nope of a great many formal expressions such as those in the kjv bible ai knows nothing it in fact has become but an instrument of pc propaganda where for example ucheud which literally can represent every human being both of male or of female has been replaced by uctheyud in the translations given by ai nobody wishes to live in the culturalmarxist dictatorship governed by their ai technocracy brbrbut i do not judge it likely that the dystopian will come to pass for the civilization of mankind particular in the west has been overall been plagued for more than half a century by dysgenics to wit waning in the faculty of intelligence hence their innovative ability to solve problems which thus will likely stall a great deal of the development of ai
well such creative poets as dryden amp shakespeare can never be replaced nor novelists like dickens amp austen
this reminds me of the universal translator in star trek
i am from austria and i think that german voice was understandable but kinda awful it didnt sound like you at all and on top it sounded very german the kind of german we dont like here at all maybe like a texan is irritated if he hears an upper class english accent donnumbert know maybe if it sounded more like you  ai can that i think or at least not an unsympathetic high german accent it would have been better
as a german speaker that german translation was super akward the first part wasnnumbert even a proper sentence also your pronunciation doesnnumbert sound like a human speaking it
hi paul inumberm a language enthusiast and a longtime follower of yours from china and younumberve made a point that i completely agree with regarding language learning in the era of ai on top of your point i also think that while ai can never replace the numberhuman touchnumber in learning and speaking a foreign language the need for language learning may inevitably dwindle most people today have at least to some extent learned another language at school for most nonenglish speakers english but do not actively use it at all after graduation even for those who do chances are most of them would only ever have a chance to use foreign languages in those numberpurely functionalnumber settings eg asking for help when traveling abroad watching videos and listening to lectures etc seeking intellectual joy from language learning is a very niche demand therefore i predict that ai translation will eliminate number of the needs that nowadays have to be fulfilled by language learning as it enables any ordinary mortal the capability of connunicating in an unlimited range of languages without costing them any time or effort whie it is true that for us language enthusiasts we are surely proud of what wenumberve learned and achieved and would never again imagine a life without it language ability will become something most people can comfortably live without it will not be killed but it will probably become a hobby for few brin fact i recently had a chance to talk with a bunch of students in china majoring in foreign languages in some of the top universities and most of them are troubled with an anxiety caused by diminishing job prospects many of them are considering transferring to other majors and some even start to detest the languages they are learning because they feel that they haved paid a huge opportunity cost by learning something that can hardly earn them a living while we treat language learning as a hobby they are betting their future on a skill thatnumbers quickly becoming obsolete a bet they feel theynumberre bound to lose this is probably the sad truth of our times
how u say numberdig itnumber in yer lingo

that was mandarin not chinese mandarin is not the only chinese language
impossible if the language doesnnumbert have a written script cantonese for example is a language which uses a foreign script which is written chinese aka written mandarinbrwhen a cantonese speaker has to write and speak out loud written chinese with a cantonese accent it makes zero sense because the written script is not adaptable to other chinese languagesbrand the thing is there exists a written cantonese form although it is seen as restricted to the lower class despite their being a history of people writing in written cantonese this is why despite cantonese having over number million speakers langauges like irish have better technical support on google translate duolingo etc
this doesnnumbert work for languages that donnumbert have a written script and basically gatekeeps while also encouraging people to learn a majority language
thing is learning a language enhances the person who learns it ai is being used to automate humanity out of the picture everything that humans do is give them experiences and a new perspective on the universewhich is why we have ai in the first place the lunatics who only care about  are pushing ai to destroy humanity and everything that made it possible to have what we have today they think ai will make them gods but it is only making them devils all it is doing is removing all the things that make humans amazing
you honestly tricked me with this one i honestly thought you were fluent in turkish and german i think the reason why many of us would be tricked is because we have preconceived ideas ufa about certain groups of people and what they look like ufd
amazing only thing is that in turkish we use present continuous conjugation for present context we keep present tense conjugation for ucwouldud meaning this was the only thing the ai missed
for turkish i think itnumbers a pretty good translation and the mouth movements are in harmony with the sounds only some tenses and modals were unnatural
i rather think ai will increase the number of speakers of an unpopular language a language with very few speakers
i think ai can facilitate genuine language learning by making comprehensive input more readily available it could be sort of like quottraining wheelsquot
i will keep watching your videos because they are very good and educational
amen
turkish is my mother tongue unumbern my opinion it is gramer correct butnot the true way of speaking maybe for bussines it can work i think cultuel notes are missing
this website does translation for uploaded videos there will be another problem with realtime translation with a wearable device the word order there are sov svo languages and more variants in some languages word order is strict in conjugated languages it may be more flexible imagine translating from german to english you have to wait for that verb show up at the end of the sentence and there are languages that donunumbert reveal gender like turkish ai may start making up heshe even it wasnunumbert the original intent this currently exists for even text but for simulatenous translation ai will have harder time to figure out the gender
will people be still necessary though
the turkish translation calques expressions in english still understable and grammaticalbut not very natural
i think you nailed this topic i agree with all you say nothing replaces watching news or even talking to strangers on the street in their own language while traveling

what i donunumbert understand is peopleunumbers belief that they understand what the impact of any new technology will be all this speculation about ai is just that  speculation the reality is that people will decide how to use ai and that will generate a lot of consequences some intended sort of and a lot of unintended consequences just think of the impact of computers on society social media has had more and more profound impact on society than lap tops will ever have and who predicted that no one compare peopleunumbers hand wringing over ai to the warnings about ragtime music and i think youunumberll get the idea for the moment personally ai is an interesting tool that helps me correct my grammar and usage while i learn a second language thatunumbers about it itunumbers no replacement for actually talking to other people in that language
all these points about quotno ai will not replace ltsomethinggt because of ltsomethinggtquot are just attempts to deny the reality it will happen the question is only how fast it all depends on how convenient a particular technology will become to acquire the worldwide popularitybra simple question are you still sending real handwritten mails to anyone maybe to see their eyes to light up that one mail you sent number years ago doesnnumbert countbrps inumberm telling it as a person who enjoyed learning a foreign language a lot years ago and benefited really a lot from it both personally and professionally
learning to paint in oil during the ies this is what it feels like i guess i learn languages as a hobby for the same reasons not to the same extent or with the same deph also a introvert i enjoy watching listening and reading in my target languages quotalles wird nur halb so heiudf gegessen wie es gekocht wirdquot
great video as always bras a native speaker of german i can confirm that the translation was impeccable no error whatsoever only the intonation a little machinelike could make us guess that itunumbers a talking algorithm brin what concerns the learning of foreign languages iunumberm completely with you it might not be necessary for communication in the close future but the pleasure of mastering different idioms has no equal i speakreadwrite number languages it certainly as you say brings people closer to each other brthis text was written without help from an ai by a nonnative speaker of the english language uf
as a turkish native speaker i can say that the translation was pretty good
i think we should also keep in mind that some languages are just too different from each other that some sentences are simply intranslatable so instant translating ai will never be number accurate also the tempo and word order differs from language to language so these devices will never be number instantaneous either
i think it will kill language learning there is a small minority that learns a language for fun but most people learn languages with a specific goal in mind most often to use them in a professional setting if that becomes obsolete then you donnumbert need to teach any foreign language at school at university or at language academies there will be no need to do exams or certifications so you donnumbert need to strive for a specific goal or try to achieve a certain level even if people are going to keep learning foreign languages this will be demoted to the level of quotfun factsquot to impress people at social gatherings not actual fluency because the motivation is just not going to be there
babelfish is coming uf

this is good news for fringe  obscure languages regions can use and learn the native language and donnumbert have to learn a nation or regionsl language so these languages can grow wales can focus on teaching welsh and not have to teach everyone english

hey paul as a translator iunumberm looking into switching my career path do you know if the developers of these tools are employing language professionals or is it reasonable to look for a completely different career
is it worth learning a language younumberll never use inumberm interested in learning lakotan but i doubt inumberll speak to someone who knows it
iubm studying mandarin for number years now and i will not stop for all the reasons that you mentioned paul thanks for the interesting video
inumberm often annoyed by youtubenumbers automatically translating video titles cuz it makes it harder for me to find videos in particular languages and google translate and chat gpt have given be more materials in target languages instead of making language learning irrelevant same will happen with voice translation
ai will always have problems with the slang and insults and drunk people calling the taxi company to get a ride home donnumbert forget that deaf people will need to communicate with their hands also language learning is a good brain exercise in the morning
the german was pretty good
as with many other skills the process is what makes it enjoyable immediate results arennumbert satisfactory because there was no effort put into it
it definitely wonunumbert the question is is this a real threat for interpreters
so long as people choose to only do business personally meeting face to face ai has no chance of taking over the language business as you said learning a language for passive consumption just reading or listening is only half as difficult as learning a language for reading listening speaking and writing for quotdeadquotancientextinct languages like biblical hebrew or sumerian etc the effort is only numbernumber as much because you only learn to read it ai will never take that away
turkish translation was flawless
the predominance of english as made learning other languages less relevant ai will just get us further down that path
omg man i was shocked when i heard turkish fuck
i think the fundamental problem is going to be the fact that these ais are trained on basically quotperfect standard languagequot or language which doesnnumbert stray far from it so inumberm not sure ais will ever handle thick accents or quotbrokenquot language as well as a skilled human theynumberll do an admirable job in the future already are sometimes on a given languagenumbers equivalent of queennumbers english but as soon as someone shows up speaking eg thick scottish or quotboroken englesh bekos thei dont ar netiv spickerquot the ainumbers probably either gonna start spouting gibberish or just give up
buekufcnstliche intelligenzuc macht man immer dooferb
i think younumberre absolutely right ai translation will be and partly already is used for things like business meetings it just makes sense for companies to invest in ai technology once instead of hiring an interpreter or paying their workers more for their foreign language proficiency but it wonnumbert be able to substitute the joy of language learning as a ukrainian living in the flemishspeaking part of belgium i find it important to learn flemish as this way i am getting closer to understanding their culture i just love these moments when i use a dialectal form or a proverb and their faces light up with a smile
hey paul turks use present continuous tense a lot more than simple tense even in formal writing so it would be quotkonuufmuyorumquot rather than quotkonuufmamquot it is not wrong it just doesnnumbert sound natural
pretty good
ai is created because society has no intelligence left in it
inumberm a native turkish speaker and yes that is more than enough for a formal job meeting it isnnumbert exactly natural or quotperfect turkishquot of course but considering you would need to learn turkish for years just to be able to get to this level itnumbers an amazing tool and it will only become better
nice summary itnumbers interesting that you class yourself as a bit of an introvert same as me so i also have a bit of performance anxiety when attempting to speak another language with native speakers and i get most of my enjoyment from reading in a foreign language or watching videos rather than speaking it but this is where ai will really be able to come into its own ie as my nevertiring noncritical language practice partner thus inumberm eagerly looking forward to future improvements in the technology i do agree that any businessrelated reasons for learning a language will rapidly go down the gurgler but this is no different to jobs in general in the longterm

when you switched to turkish i was like wtf dude

it can never be instantaneous because word order is do different gonna be a several second delay but yeah no doubt this will be widely used for quotreal timequot communications very soon
but every language related job is becoming vanished even the translation of achademic works i even believe there will be devices that translate audio ilike you say something and then in says out loud the translation very soom
ai at this time is not very good at idiomatic expressions i had a video call with a friend in brazil the other day and towards the end of the call we were talking about a location so far away that it was difficult to access out of nowhere i said it was uconde judas perdeu as botasud which is a slang in portuguese for somewhere so far away the surprise look on her face and the laugher she gave was priceless she said it was a good use of the idiom thatnumbers the kind of thing ai cannumbert figure out at this time still i would like to implement ai more as a language learning tool
i speak both turkish and german and i am not gonna lie i wouldve number believed you put in the effort and learned either one of those itnumbers really well done and this is just ai being out in the public for a year now
damn if ai can already do this then every job will be replaced by ai soon what the hell are we going to do
itunumbers about to happen and prolly sooner than later the days for a lot of interpreters translators and english teachers native speakers and nonnative speakers are numbered  ai will disrupt their business ai will put them out of commission unumberpermanently
quotdeinquot deutsch ist perfekt 
wow as a german i have to say this sounds so authentic thatnumbers actually really scary but i agree with the reasons you enumerated for continuing to learn different languages
ai might create so many intercultural realities that people will have more and more incentivation to get to know a foreign culture and its language
the key thing is that in many cases the translation itself make not much sense think about bible translations they are all not answering many questions perfect translations arennumbert available in principalbranother think when you speak with someone in private here ai mediator will not add a lot
the german translation is very good and very comprehensible but there was at least one grammatical error i noticed
if ai could diverse the people who gets the nobel prize in literature and stear away from the very european and western european languages including a few slavic language authors that would be great if great ai would be used at hospitals for communication about health care and procedures so that lots of immigrants would be getting better health care this could be implemented in laws as well that would be wonderful but donnumbert take away the fun in listening to music in other languages and understanding the lyrics
most work officies hospitals content creation will become automated but close human contact and work like refugee camps kindergarten teachers nursing will not it is a very different experience knowing that someone took the time to learn your specific language and therefore probably also knows quite a bit about your culture
why would it i mean certainly not for those of us who study other languages out of curiosity i donnumbert see how ai would reduce my curiosity maybe itnumberll put translators and interpreters out of a job but not kill language learning
inumberve always been good at spelling and grammar but any time i feel obsolete i can look at a few comments and be glad that i donnumbert quotsound likequot an untutored idiot i literally could care less about the exponential growth of functional literary ignorance
in the years of watching your videos because theyunumberre so fascinating i knew you were passionate about language but this video showed the emotional part of your passion and added more of my appreciation for your work well done paul
i really appreciated your explanations near the end of this video because this is one of the reasons i love learning languages like using a time machine to communicate with people who lived in a far distant past and country and i am feeling like a detective or archeologist deciphering very mysterious or old writings i feel an extraordinary emotion and pride by doing that as an introvert myself but not particularily shy i really enjoy speaking to people from time to time i feel i can achieve a deep comprehension of a language and its culture or way of thinking that i could not grasp if i were using only ai besides learning a language is very stimulating for brain and its development
great video paul you always put great thought into your offerings yes i think ai has usefulness in certain circumstances but iunumberd still rather learn a language on my own rather than relying on software itunumbers more engaging for the brain i enjoy the learning process and as you mentioned the joy in communicating with someone in another languageunumber and being understood uf
shortly you and us love languages so we can get ai aside
excellent video now please do one on creative ways one can use ai to enhance the efficiency of learning foreign languages
it made tl easy but its still some years away before you can skip learning and use ai tools and then probably some devices like in the hitchhikernumbers guide to the galaxy appear where you eat or somehow connect that thing and it will automatically tl speech to your language
i think i will yes although whereas my motivation for learning french was a bit more of a practical one learning japanese has always been about understanding untranslated content stuff that was never going to get localised if ai means that i could have engaged with things without learning it i think a younger me might not have seen the point in the exercise still now i feel that the experience of reading the original japanese couldnnumbert be replaced by ai the language is simply different enough with its own flavour that i wouldnnumbert neccesarily want to just read a translation anyways brbras a job though language interpretation and translation is somewhat doomed and i lament that i would have liked to maybe see how language skills could have turned into something of a career in the future itnumbers a real shame to me that it will not really be a viable option anymore even if thatnumbers not what i do for work right now the chance for instance for me to get a transfer from work to another country because i have a language seems very reduced now and that is a sad thing to considerbrbredit  one bonus to this might be the easing of the spread of english around the world maybe the number of people that are bilingual in their language and english will go down the evil voice in my brain sees that as a good thing haha
woow what ia can do is really incredible but it still needs to improve a bit the turkish i heard was almost flawless but some sentences sound obtrusive apparently it is directly translating from english and that thing sometimes doesnnumbert work for instance when a native turkish speaker hears a sentence like number o tufcrkuee konuufmaznumber what they will understand will not be numberhe doesnnumbert speak turkish number rather what they will understand will be that number he is insisting on not speaking turkishnumber as in turkish the simple present tense is not used in that sense it is not something he doesnnumbert do but he cannot do the use of grammatical structures are not always parallel in different languages you know a second thing is style i didnnumbert hear a welleducated gentle language expert person with that number fluentin turkish paulnumber that persona sounded much like a everyday street guy probably close to his thirties unemployed and still living with parents and let alone being some bookish most probably has never turned the cover of a single book in his life i think translation is not merely translating words or sentences but ia will also be able to mimic the sentiments personalities and souls of the source people very soon
one of the most astonishing things where ai can make an enormous breakthrough is the realm of writing both literary and journalistic writing because ai can do those tasks can create really good stories and reports and what is more incredible ai can do that very very well it can be a tool for writers and journalists by the way what do you think about that paul
the german translation was believable and ok but it started of in the middle of a sentence
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera younumberre wrong about that ai is already capable in these areas you need to keep up with the breakneck pace of ai improvements uf
i think younumberre overestimating how real time these real time translations can get in most cases the algorithm has to wait until the end of a sentence to produce an actual result and therenumbers absolutely no way of getting around it this delay between input and output is akin to a video with sound that is delayed in relation to the visuals by a few frames and we all know how awful is this to watch brbrai will level the playing field a little but knowing the language will always be an advantage in every case
of all the skills and professions that ai is said to threaten inumberm absolutely confident that language translation is one of them language translation is one of the tasks that ai is extremely good at and would only get better at
you might not get the opportunity to travel and speak to people when half the jobs are gone and younumberre fighting over whatnumbers left itnumbers very scary uf
soo google translate got better it has been at your fingers for a long time now it is old tech not an ai overtake of the world the imagery and voice are just nonai functions ai is a hype that will most probably crash in number
inumberm intrigued by languages and polyglots have been fascinating me for a long time perhaps itnumbers because i lack the talent to really learn and become good enough to use multiple languages i donnumbert know anyway i agree that ai may in the not too distant future results in a numberglobal translatornumber app to help people find their way in foreign lands but it wonnumbert be good enough to completely replace the skill of being able to speak another language btw ini saat yang sangat pas untuk mengikuti berita dari indonesia karena sebentar lagi akan ada pemilihan presiden uf
more ai realtime support will take a lot of pressure off inumberve always wanted languages to be just for fun to me it will remove some of my panic as to which language to focus on because it would make it easier to consume content in languages i donnumbert know yet so if language learning became more like knitting  fewer people making a living out of it but a relaxing hobby for many  that would be fine by me
as a native speaker of mandarin chinese i think the translation is like numbernumber it works but definitely sounds like a foreigner trying to speak chinese
inumberm a native speaker of german i have to admit that the ai is very good except the structure of the passive is a little bit different as in english i would use it a little bit differentlybri grew up with many friends of turkish origin i would say that inumberm quite use to the sound of turkish it sounds a little bit chopy

i am a native mandarin speaker living in china at the time i am writing this comment inumberll say that ai translation has a very standard pronunciation known as putonghua in china but the text is mediocre at most i can get what it means but nobody who speaks chinese as their mother tongue will speak in that way not even in formal situations just getting the grammar correct does not equal being nativelike or humanlike is this due to a problem in lexiconbrlearning a language is often out of practical need or fun but for some language learning is a way to build their cultural identity that is different from the ones they were born into this is especially true for immigrants who are desperately seeking verification from nonimmigrants about their adopted national identity speaking the dominant local language well is often seen as crucial evidence of quotassimilationquot of immigrants by nonimmigrants i know this is sort of unfair but having adequate knowledge of the dominant local language does have a significant impact on a newcomernumbers civil liberty branother case is when there is severe discrimination and oppression sometimes even outright persecution of minority groups based on noncultural identities such as being lgbtq or disabled foreign or second languages that carried information with progressive views are often seen as the key to freedom and justice learning these languages can be a way to liberation and may eventually lead to seeing this language as a part of the personnumbers identity even if they are never able to settle down in countries where the language is widely spoken
translations can never be perfect because some sentences can be interpreted in different ways and itnumbers impossible for anyone except the original speaker to know the meaning
this is shoching
i think at the end of the day is best to just turn yourself into an avatar in vr and live with everyone who come from anywhere in the world so you can just let the avatar speak for itself and you move it around to others which is pretty much happening already in things like vrchat so a lot of the ai stuff donnumbert really need to happen in real life real life will come to vr instead of ar
i mean you donnumbert learn language to only speak in it on the internet voice what about understanding everything that is said or written in it instantly or even using it in real life inumberm against anyone who thinks that installing a chip in your brain is a possible solution those are too far gone
not learning a language wonunumbert help you develop your brain relying on ai will make people lazy and stupid
this was fascinating i honestly didnnumbert know about that technology that can translate your own speech in video form one thing that might also be good and bad if the info gets out and others can use it is having a record of your voice and being able to type something and have your own voice read it out for example for videos there would be no quotmultiple takesquot and it would perfectly mimic the text in your voice whatever the future of ai brings i intend to keep studying japanese
inumberve never been that good at learning languages inumberll get feedback that my pronunciation is good but my comprehension is poor i do use google translate to read song lyrics and results areodd but for translations i can trust inumberd want a translator
merhaba kardeufim
i really do hope ai makes language barriers in reading and writing a thing of the past though i hope language learning can still thrive even with technology advances i donunumbert think ai can ever get to the point of fully understanding the nuances and creativity that can come from another language like humans can
i hope that ai keeps getting better at conversing with us as we learn the language imagine having an ai thatnumbers always there to help explaining all the details fixing pronunciation and helping with grammar and vocabulary it would make learning languages even more enjoyable and effective and when you add to this the possibility of live conversation we have the full package
as i native chinese speaker i can understand the translation very well had i not known your voice i would think you are a foreigner whonumbers been living in china for a very long time though there are a few moments where the choice of word is a bit odd not wrong but no one speaks like that i can definitely see how people may think this video is authentic
there will be no need to learn languages in the near future
i learned esperanto only because learning a language was something unattainable for me whole my life but esperanto just clicked after that i was learning languages out of love for languages their sound look grammar culture
youtube polyglots beware
ai chinese is very bad but german is fine i speak both languages as a native
why every video about ai has to do this quotoh all this was actually iaquot thing
giving a completely different answer to the title of your video ucwill ai kill language learningud ai couldunumberand shouldunumberbe used to iaugmenti language learning and is uniquely suited to do so because it can generate correct grammatical sentences iandi detect incorrect ones in target languages and will only get better to the extent that it doesnunumbert so itunumbers basically the language ucdrill sergeantud ucdrillud in terms of instruction that is with inexhaustible patiencebrbrdesigned properly a language learning ai could guide you through the basics of a language in a way that no textbook or current language app can because its responses and next steps would be based on your individual responsesunumberit would be flexibly tailored to you and based on your mistakes or simply at your request it could go over some point that you didnunumbert understand or allow you to practice some grammar point or construction with more and more varied examples it wouldnunumbert substitute for human tutors because there really is no substitute for human interactionunumberi read with regret that one commenter feels that his or her job as a professional language tutor has been ucautomated awayudunumberbut it could make selflearning or the time between language lessons a lot more productive and fun because you could spend a lot less time figuring out iwhati and ihowi to learn and a lot more just ilearningi
ai translation will only work for me if i have it what about the times i donnumbert have it
i speak german pretty well the translation and lipsynch matching was very convincing to me
i guess i understand your point i enjoy anime and i watch it with japanese voice actors but english subtitles still inumberm aware that there is a lot of nuance in the japanese language that inumberm missing and it has compelled me to learn some japanese
i study written chinese but inumberve never used it functionally and have never had a sustained conversation in chinese i have read classic novels in english translation like dream of red mansions story of the stone but i get a thrill from reading a few pages of cao xueqin in the original maybe someday inumberll be able to read a whole chapter in one sitting
there is value in connecting with a culture in business that includes learning the language connecting with people and not leaning on a translation device
for the german part it sounds like a machine so far odd choice of some words the rhythm and melody of the sentence is offbrbasically sounds like all those scam ads you get on youtube quotstudents found the perpetuum mobile and want to sell it on this hidden website you cannot find on google bit only on ads as the energy companies would otherwise close it downquot  yeah surebrwell maybe not as bad based on this small snippet but it does feel offbrmight change soon if they get real multimodal models out into the world
can you do a video on your accent and dialect it was very funny seeing people think you were not a native speaker of english lol
there is a problem with the structure of languages that seems to enable an accurate translation real time it will not happen in the short term
first of all my musical ear immediately picked up on a serious limitation of this software that i donnumbert really see how it could overcome and which would make real time translation impossible brthe software cannumbert make your voice produce a sound that wasnnumbert already in the audio you provided the software is sampling your voice and then rearranging the sounds you made as appropriate thing is sometimes a language needs a sound you didnnumbert provide the german section just doesnnumbert work because you didnnumbert say quotauquot or quotufcquot the first sound occurs in english but is very rare and thus was not in the audio file you provided the second sound just doesnnumbert occur in english not even allophonically in the standard dialect plus itnumbers also full of grammatical anglicisms the mandarin chinese only works because younumberre american ucft jufast suf hueppuens thucet unumbermuerudcuen ucngluecsh cufntueins thub sueme fuedve tufnes unumbers muendunumberruecn chuednuese sorry for that mess europeans if you were british it would not british english is missing the crucial middle tone it has high tone instead outside of east asia the only languages that have the correct five tones for mandarin are american standard english and the scandinavian languages and a norwegian would still end up sounding like a comedy character because the tones would be ridiculously exaggerated german has five tones but theynumberre the wrong ones french has only three spanish and italian have only two the turkish only works because english is one of the few languages that distinguishes quotchquot and quotshquot if you started with french audio it would fail not only is numberchnumber the same as numbershnumber but there is also no glide quotturueunumberyequot would come out as quotturshiuequot i highly doubt a turkish speaker would be amused or impressed if indeed that isnnumbert some sort of swearword the ai is only deciding how to rearrange the sounds you made it still cannot and probably never will be able to manufacture a sound that you did not actually provide to it brai will only ever be able to produce real time subtitles nor is the slight delay something which can ever be remedied think about how german verbs often come only at the end of the sentence no matter how good the ai is it will have to wait until the full sentence has been spoken before providing an accurate translation it will not get any better than this in the future sorry
inumberm actually kind of frightened that we are entering a world where nothing that we do is necessary doing things only for enjoyment seems pointless to me
native turkish and fluent german speaker here  the turkish part sounded really unnatural and not in the sense that it lacked the paralinguistic elements it sounds as though it was translated wordbyword german section was really robotic but no problems outside of that
ai only makes sense under capitalism if your goal is simply to be a more fufilled happy human being replacing opportunities for personal development with artifical tools makes no sense

the chip in the brain straight up hitchhikernumbers guide to the galaxy stuff quotbabelfishquot namesake of the old translation site you inserted a fish in your ear for instant interpretationbrbrthe turkish here was mostly grammatically correct albeit a little formal and textbookish fully understandable but sounds kinda unnatural
if ai does every little thing for us in the future life will be incredibly boring
i almost believed you were speaking turkish i thought you could totally have learned that language brfor mandarin and german i noticed especially for german because i bamb german and i can hear how you sound if younumberre actually speaking for mandarin it was the sound of the tones that werennumbert basb natural but still incredibly good learned mandarin myself the tones were very hard for me and i heard it a lot bri ofc also have to acknowledge that it could have been more obvious because i knewbrbrinumberm currently learning middle egyptian because inumberm studying archaeology and also know readspeak latin and ancient greek for these two languages wenumberre pretty confident in how it sounded but for egyptian we have barely an idea because they didnnumbert write their vowels we only have the consonant skeletonbrinumberd be bfascinatedb to see if ai would be able to better reconstruct the sounds for us by feeding it the reconstructed protolanguage the coptic derivates and sibling languages combined with bi or trilingual documents in eg ptolemaic greek or assyrian bri would love to know how ai could help us discover these things
i have no doubt that ai also can help with learning languages i was traveling in many countries that used to be a part of the ussr i was at an intermediate stage at that point in time and google translate was really useful the times that i either did not understand a word or the times i did not know a word would not mind having some type of ai glasses or ai earpices yo translate when im struggeling

german sounded really close to perfect
studied abroad at one of the two best universities in all of asia for almost two years immersion only allowed to speak chinese and that chinese translation made me whip around while doing chores that takes years i knew ai translation was already amazing but i hadnnumbert heard it with mandarin until then jeese
not kill it but it will make it less and less useful which actually itunumbers not very useful today anywaybrlet me explain most people with good jobs or important positions in an enterprise or government hire other people to do that very job that ai will do in many countries even with a good life standard language learning is not seen necessary for most take spain for an instance despite living close to france buying stuff from america a country they love to say they hate but show how much they love and being ruled by germany since they are part of the eu are always claiming for everything to be translated to castilian otherwise they wonunumbert even look at it bronly a handful of people get to make a living out of learning a language most people do it for extreme necessity ei are immigrants or have to deal in a daily basis with people who speak another language for business or just for funbrit might not kill it but it sure will take it to the brink of extinction
the chinese rendition is actually terrible phonetically speaking the ai got every tone correct but when put together intonation is very rigid and moreover the translation itself is just not right
guys tech isnnumbert a god
yeah neologisms colloquiallisms names and surnames not accounted for in the ai database and even things as simple as the context of the conversation may be a difficult for ai to understand but the real question is are we really supposed to be as relient on technology as we are and even more in the future
inumberd like to mention two additional points at this issuebrbrnumber i think ai will never be able to understand context faithfully for example take the word quotspringquot it may be a season name a mechanical tool a source of water or an uprising so how do you translate quotarab springquot believe me some dumb journalist certainly used a translation tool and got quotprimavera uerabequot primavera  season and now the entire brazilian people says it this waybrbrnumber if you has read quotdunequot you will promptly understand this point the more you rely on machines to do your brain work the more younumberll be weak and dependent on them to learn how to emit a vowel or consonant or tone absent in your mother language is quite an exercise a challenge that gives you joy when you finally manage to do it well
i love how the entire society is experiencing essentially the modern art movement we have to redefine what makes human human as technology is catching up
it would mean closing the defense language institute in monterey california that valuable real estate can then be turned over to monterey and pacific grove for redevelopment
do you not think when real time langauge translation becomes practical it will mean that english is no longer useful as a lingua franca i know lots of young people nowadays globally are very keen to learn english due to how widespread it is in mass media and the web but maybe future generations wonnumbert bother trying to learn english sticking to their mother tongue
the german translation was way off i think the sentence structure was confusing for the ai and so the grammar was not correct also the voice sounded quite robotic it is not taking anybodyunumbers job yet uf
reading the title inumberd answer yes it most probably willbrmap technology already killed navigation skills with ai doing automatic translations why would anyone do the effort of learning a new language unless you just actually love learning languages and younumberre forever student but it will make the need to learn impractical and unnecessary
inumberm sad
turkish is ugly uf
the thing with turkish is no one speaks the perfect turkish like your ki literally no one even in formal situations the official turkish language isnt spoken like quothochdeutschquot there are always some nuances which differs you from a native to a professional learner speaking perfectly turkish cant be learned even if you are living number years in turkey thats a fact
ai can translate newspapers or bills of lading maybe stereo instructions however translating mother goose let alone fenagannumbers wake or the odes of pindar is another thing real indepth understanding will always require language learning ai translation will still be profoundly useful it just cannumbert cover all possibilities
you may also want to consider how some communities are really strict about learning their language most europeans speak english but not all europeans like to speak english with foreigners
i think one place where language learning wonnumbert go away is probably in military intelligence and itnumbers for that reason you said ai will probably struggle with the deeper nuances of languagebrbrinumberm a p cryptologic language analyst in the us army that specializes in korean and i can tell you that if they were to try and replace our job with ai it would be a disaster because ai relies on mass data consumption from across the internet in order to produce but what if the target is extremely numbershynumber like the north koreans are north koreanumbers internet footprint is extremely small so an ai couldnnumbert do my job because therenumbers too little data for them to use and this is true for a lot of other enemies to the us especially those in africa and the middle east places that donnumbert have as robust a connection to the internet
inumberm not real
the first part of the german doesnnumbert seemed completly correct the second part is more or less correct but didnnumbert sound as german native speaker brhowever that flaws were not too big and one could get what you or ai are trying to say in some years it will barely distinctable from real people like a news anchors
wherever two languages have different word orders it is impossible to translate until enough is known about the input and that makes it unsuitable for live translationbras for the translated video it quotsynchronizesquot the lips and messes up everything else doing so it is very obvious the translation into german isnnumbert bad but i very obvious automatically translated
i love my intermediate german for all the reasons paul describes and i was thrilled to recently spend a week in berlin and use it all the time even things like taking the german tours in museums not the english tour bri find that ai is super helpful for countless questions i have in german as shown in a random dialogue i had with ai this morning bra hrefhttpsbqwebpageblogspotcomnumbernumberchatgpttutorsintermediategermanhtmlmnumberhttpsbqwebpageblogspotcomnumbernumberchatgpttutorsintermediategermanhtmlmnumbera
again as in every affected area not everyone will lose their job just number of people involved will
as a language enthusiast who also works in the realm of speech technologies i feel ai shouldnunumbert be a replacement but a complement of language learning there will be novel teachinglearning methods thanks to the revolution of llms and they may clear many barriers in the learning of some difficult languages like mandarin and arabic or even ancient languages they can also be leveraged to preserve the endangered languages by encouraging more people to learn them with more intelligentaccessibleimmersive approaches

you reveiled another aspect younumberre geekier than i thought younumberve got a gaming keyboard is that a razorblade younumberre into tech arennumbert ya
ai should be used as a complimentary tool not as a human substitution to replace humans should be control such technology so they can use it to its full potential never rely on technology use critical sense
as a nonnative speaker of german that does bsoundb correct but obviously not native and donnumbert use it oftenbrso infrequently that i did have to rely on the subtitles to doublecheck but it sounded good
i think there will be circumstances where these new machine translation tools will come up short older computer games for example may not play well with on the fly text or speech translations also for newer works a human translator will be the first step of quality control for translations of prerecorded speech or prewritten text

i can genuinely relate with paulnumbers language learning experience as a nonnative english speaker i have never given english language the attention it deserves as the expression of a complex culture and history just because for me itnumbers more of a quotfunctionalquot language itnumbers a lingua franca and you often end up speaking it but i may be somewhat more interested in other languages even if or maybe because you rarely get to speak it just as paul i learn them to understand news books and online content rather than to speak them for me functionality is the least important driver of interest in a language for the rest language learning is an exclusively human experience itnumbers the journey that matters not the destination

i love watching the news in pig latin
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera the german translation is very good and somewhat frightening knowing what is now possible less than number years ago i used to make some extra money by translating technical german articles to english it was a tedious and timeconsuming process now the client could simply enter the text in google translate and it would be gtnumber correct even the grammar am i wasting my time learning russian then again knowing a foreign language and being able to converse fluently with native speakers while sitting around the dinner table is something ai will never be able to replace lots of people who met a foreign partner on an online dating site had an excellent connection chatting for hours but when they met in person the relationship fell apart  conversing via a translation program is just too painful
learning a second language improved my life and help me fight depression that started with me after puberty in highschool number years later my life is way better
even though chatgpt style quotaiquot has been around for a while now google translate has been around for far longer and it is notoriously unreliable brbrmaybe the new generative algorithims which is what the current ai really is computers arennumbert conscious just yet are at least better than google translate but i donnumbert believe they will fully replace translators at the very least real translators would still be needed to correct mistakes in the generative language model brbreven if documents can be quottranslatedquot by the algorithm a human translator will still need to be paid to do a grammar and content check because algorithms arennumbert great with context emotional intent or localisation from an algorithm you may only get a transliteration which still has to be translated by a person brbras for the brain chipsit may be possible someday but the current technology seems unsafe given the reports about neuralinknumbers animal trials breven when thatnumbers fixed i think many people would view it as an extreme privacy violation and not use it ultimately though whatever happens with ai i think younumberre right that people will want to learn languages anyway to make more friends and understand different cultures and perspectives
i donnumbert believe that ai wonnumbert be able to speak idioms slangs and local dialects it already does it
the added clips in foreign languages reminded me of me hanging around with friends and using all the languages we learnt uf just switching into one of them makes us happy so as a hobby it stays for many years but for work and other essential tasks such as first help or excursions ai will substitute peopleunumbers knowledgeufa
the german one was kinda weird
i think that ai will make language skills less functional and more recreational there will always be people who want to learn a language because itnumbers fun and interesting a new language enables you to make new friends it adds a whole new dimension to travel abroad and how can you study a culture without studying the language that goes with it you might not need a second language for work but employers will always be impressed with the application and mental agility of a person who has learned a foreign language people always warm to you when you speak their languagebran increasing number of people are learning languages of their forebears ai will never replace the joy that comes of being part of a language revitalization movementbrinumberm getting old now and i learn new languages to exercise my brain in order to stave off dementia there is no finer exercise for the brain than taking on a new language inumberm studying sanskrit nowbrand one wouldnnumbert want to use an ai interpreter in the boudoir would one
thanks for creating
language is too abstract to be fully grasped by ai
if we were only interested in functionality we could just make everyone speak english inumberd argue that insisting on doing things for reasons other than efficiency is one of the things that makes us humans
send this to the university of aberdeen who are struggling to keep language degrees open
iunumberm a language teacher and learner i donunumbert think ai will ever fully replace native speakers due to all the reasons you mentioned learning a language is also about learning the culture and connecting with people ai canunumbert do that i also substitute my learning with ai and other sources like yt and movies but it doesnunumbert replace having a teacher fyi all my language teachers have been online
i learn languages and about languages because somehow i am caught by them their sound their structure i never thought of them as a tool to make money i think that ai can also be of great help for learning a new language by the way the german ai translation of your voice is perfect i canunumbert speak turkish but i paid attention to you and couldnunumbert tell if it was you or not speaking it i thought ucwow he is also fluent in turkishud
with chinese being my l i say that the ai generated chinese is incredible despite the obvious foreign acceent not sure whether the accent is intentional or a result of imperfect program
the short answer is no we language lovers like me learn languages because we love the experience to know new words to know how to pronounce new sounds itnumbers a passion not about economy or industry if someone has enough time and the passion will continue learning languages even if quotaiquot acquire god tier intelligence this quotaiquot shit is pointless in many areas
awesome video but i really missed quotthank you for watching and have a nice day quot at the end
honestly iunumberm scared ai might replace everything at some point
ai is totally useless without electricity
so ai will help us with work however it will not be able to replace humanity we will need to get more in touch with our emotions and understanding who we are so that we can become better people being authentic will matter more than being ucusefuludcool
as a native speaker the german one definitely sounds robotic but itnumbers perfectly understandable the problem is that it doesnnumbert like a native but also not like someone who learned german later on it really is in the uncanny valley for me
as a native chinese speaker i think the translation is just perfect if i didnnumbert watch your previous videos i would thought you learned chinese secretly and had mastered it although the tone seems a little unnaturalnot like human but therenumbers no mistakes i can find and itnumbers really impressive
inumberve noticed similar reactions to ai across other fields such as software and art where those reactions can sure get more lively than with language learning in all three fields people seem concerned about keeping their jobs as much as they are interested in the techbrbryounumberre also not the only one who thinks ai will make human works more valuable and i agree here the rise of ai simply made me more motivated to create stuff which seems to be the opposite of most people
i learn languages fir tge same reason
even if ai can translate in realtime with number accuracy it still cannumbert beat the experience of actually knowing a language
nobut it will make it all better
well the german part sounds pretty convincing although unnatural paul the problem is you cannumbert compensate for illiteracy ai isnnumbert ai but machine learning and i see that google bing and yandex translation tools are still messing up when the texts donnumbert follow writing standards regarding syntax and orthographybrbrai to me is just a numberbuzzwordnumber and is far fetch from being good enough to replace humans in several activities machine learning the right term from a programmernumbers standpoint is full of biases which are inherited from the people who programmed and trained them
i have been teaching languages for number years and i will say that number of people learn languages because they need to if there is no need they will not learn the ones who study languages for fun are so few that their amount is totally negligible so if this video is right there will be no language learning pretty soon
i still refuse to use the backup camera on a car
can ai speak colloquial australianbrnot bloody likely mate
i see how ai language is an amazing tool if all of a sudden you need to communicate in klingon or perhaps elvish i find that really cool but not for personal interaction language connects you with the culture perhaps thatnumbers why esperanto never became an official language of anything there is no people or culture behind it inumberm sure that if they made elvish a universal language it will be far more popular albeit fictitious the is an amazing culture and people behind the language besides who wouldnnumbert want to be an elveufuf

looooove the dig at elon musk that had me busting out laughing
good in theory i believe ai would have a massive issue with many idioms expressions understanding tones of language  no not tonal languages but tone of voice to express themselves brcertain stress factors and the nuisances of any language that present itselfbrbrgoogle translate for instance only get about number of the entire message with multiple paragraphs which is complex difficult and hard to pose understandingbrbrdonnumbert think a i will completely takeover language learning incredible less so languages themselves too much pride on the line and many nowdays countries fought for those territories and language presided
well said ai will make many things obsolete but never human connection nor our natural curiosity nor our need for self expression these are powerful motivators
i believe itnumbers not just about business or formal conversations but also culture think of multilingual countries for example like canada belgium switzerland etc where i personally believe people should have a decent understanding of the languages and cultures within their countrynumbers boundaries as itnumbers prominent to keep their national identities and keep them integrated there are also dying languages that will become even more irrelevant if ai completely replaces language learning as they most likely wonnumbert support them or would have really bad quality

german native here  the translation in my opinion works well but i would at this stage not recommend using it outside of the business world let alone due to the countless nuances a language has it is hard to exactly deliver the message you meant to with the tool i could imagine i think there is a reason why people can recognise automatically translated things and go quotoh that sounds like google translatequot for example even though you could technically speak every language in the world with such an ai tool it wont make you truly master it there is so much more to it than just words the countrynumbers culture the social status of your conversation partner and so on but it is still really impressive
one other benefit of language learning is that itnumbers very stimulating for the brain and makes you more eloquent in your own tongue imo it just makes you a more interesting person therenumbers some indication that it may make you less likely to develop dementia or alzheimernumbers later in life though the jury is still out on that
native chinese speaker here  the chinese did not sound natural
the thing is ai cannot understand context and there are homonyms that are very likely to be mistranslated
will this mean that interpreting and translating jobs will be unnecessary
ai already killing jobs for years in my software company we use deepl api translation for almost number years now to translate user interface texts of our apps before we had to hire professionial human translators

paul finding your video on scandinavian languages lead me on a journey in learning about languagesalso jackson crawford with ai inumberll still be interested in learning
i completely agree paul i think most of the people who like learning languages do it because of the reasons you mentioned because we love how it feels to be able to understand this or that in the languages that we like so really hope that even if we have those incredible tools in the near future people will keep interested in learning languages because itnumbers a great experience bralso we help our brains against alzheimer uf

itnumbers like saying we have calculators why need math same logic it appears to me so

hiiiii can you make a video about sign languages thabks
inumberm learning chinese ai makes learning chinese so much easier i can have conversations in chinese about whatever i want whenever i want for as long as i want and nobody gets impatient or annoyed at my chinese when it malfunctions
i find ai very useful for learning some new vocabulary and reading customised short texts anyway its always me who give it orders and the brain remains mine
so how many languages does paul currently speak 
inumberm brazilian and love very much german culture and language and also dutch i studied them read them hear songs from pop into classical music in those languages ai will never change this love those languages which are not really important to teacher tasks in brazil in which most of sources are in portuguese spanish or english
itunumbers great for when you really need to get your point across with a language barrier but i havenunumbert changed my duolingo goals yet
i was really interested to see and hear you using that software to speak languages i would love to see more of this for me i would like to see you try out finnish
i liked the fact that you did an opinion piece i almost entirely agree  except for the neural link part something like the knowledge of a language is too complex at least going on from the technique we use today
i could definitely tell your chinese seemed off i cannumbert put my finger on it but some uncanny valley effect
i had a very unpleasant experience last week someone who saw and knew i was learning many languages felt i was a nerd who had no life i could imagine for this person language learning is only a functional skill something to impress people or put on a cv what they cannumbert see is what language actually is how it can be a fascinating activity in its own right how it is window into other cultures and hence the world outside of the english speaking one being an affront to the dominance of english and english media and arrogance of its speakers is a good enough reason alone
another excellent video never disappoints
for turkish yes it is pretty good however your tone is a little bit monotone and the stress is not correctly given for grammer there are some small problems because of the confusion between simple present tense and prensent continuous tense we dont use simple present in some contexts instead naturally we use present continuous although the meaning is simple present in englishbri am really impressed it is one of the best idea after formal quotwearingquot tools in zoom meetings
inumberm trying to learn polish in order to help with my genealogy research the classes inumberve tried seem to be focused on modern conversational language but i just want to be able to read and understand old documents since many of the th century documents inumberve found are hand written in cursive polish and german even modern young people can no longer read them so inumberve learned to read the old polish and fraktur german cursive scripts and have to transcribe the letters into ascii text then copy and paste into an online translating tool this is tedious so i hope ai will get better at scanning and translating such texts
the pronunciation of the german video was pretty good but the sentence structure sounded unnatural so it was easy to tell that it was created by aibrand what you said about the additional level of authenticity of genuine language learning is so true there is such a deep and unconscious connection when you hear someone speaking in your native dialect and there is this great feeling of achievement when you managed to express yourself in a foreign language even if not perfectly and i also like how you learn to see the world from many different angles
inumberve learnt romanian to impress the girls and they are damn impressed my feeling about it is great will ai implant impress that much nope
i cannumbert believe that neither paul nor anyone else has used the expression quotbabel fishquot in this discussion

the turkish part was enough to counter the argument it was unnatural the way words were arranged and pronouns were used
ai will probably never be able to translate languages with few speakers in sweden we have at least number small indigenous languages spoken by up to a few thousand people it will take like a thousand years for ai to collect enough information to be able to translate them and there is many languages lika that around the world
ai will only get faster cheaper and omnipresent also better as users require but one great ability of chatbots is to chat ai will be the best language tutors possible patient attentive and able to track progress and add new vocabulary as needed

iunumberm currently learning japanese and no matter how frustrating it gets i have never dreamed to have someone snap their fingers and instantly make me fluent in japanese language learning is such a joy and i would hate to lose the chance to experience it with the language i want to learn the most

i probably overheard this but the beginning of the german translation is a bit odd there is no article even though inumberd expect one ein video or plural wo article videos regardless of whether the translation is just supposed to seamlessly switch from chinese over to german or not but thatnumbers meckern auf hohem niveau from an angehende dolmetscherin 
perfect ai translation is possible only if the ai fully understands the context otherwise it contains mistakes
i want no chip nowhere close to my brain
as a native turkish speaker i can say the turkish part was perfect not a single mistake or an offbeat sentence wow
perfection maybe best video so far ufaa keep it up
ai will be mostly on the commercial applications of anything as you mentioned for the geeks language will be always in our hearts for whatever reason unumber
yes lolbruncontrolled ai spread and humans relying solely on ai will destroy not only language learning but all the civilization that we have built up until now
i definitely will i like the manual effort of putting focus into languages too i donunumbert like using never use ucsmartud devices like siri or alexa because i find talking to technology makes you mentally lazy the more we become dependent on technology the less of our brain power is used technology is a good tool but it should never be a replacement of your own abilities that you possess i started learning languages basically by accident i was experiencing intense social anxiety where i didnunumbert want to go out in public and i didnunumbert really have friends because of it and i used languages to help me overcome social anxiety it also taught me the power of giving before i learned languages i never saw the value of giving because i felt like i didnunumbert have anything value to give learning languages is truly the ultimate act of giving you give comfort to people since the people know you put your heart into learning their culture and languageunumber

it could happen that no one will release a software that automatically translates esperanto because itnumbers not used in business
the most important comments inumberve read so far coincide with those in my industry which is art and entertainment the problem with ai is that it might start to put in danger whole careers and employments works and employments that have been earned through academic preparation and degrees it is not the automatization of manual labor and low skill employments wenumberre talking about people who have dedicated their whole lives to linguistics language learning art and design literature and writing there is a reason hollywood entered a huge strike recently ai might put in danger and make unstable some of the most sought after and beloved careers we have

younumberre a man after my own heart paul and you have a nose after my own nose celtic ai cannumbert rob us of that practicality has never driven my passion for languages the only language inumberve ever learned of necessity is arabic for the navy i was a translator and i hated it and was terrible at it the whole ten years of my professional involvement with it it wasnnumbert until years later after regaining my faith in jesus christ that my heart toward it changed i had deliberately forgotten most of my arabic and one day i came to my senses numberwhat am i doing inumberm an idiot to want to lose this giftnumber so i began praying to god for help with relearning the language and reading the bible in arabic i had never prayed for help with it before the change was immediate and astonishing before long i was far better than i had ever been before and instead of antipathy i now had a new and enthusiastic love for the arabic language  and the bible years later my fire is still burning ardentlybrbri share all this because you mentioned loving biblical greek and hebrew which i am also learning and love in fact inumberm going to be studying them this coming year at university as part of my theology major admittedly thatnumbers the part inumberm most excited about ufa so now my question is are you a christian toobrbrthanks if you read all this god bless you
paul your office is all fancy now  german translation is good enough but with no regionalism at all  remember everyone ai is just a computer theynumberre fooling you into buying more products by scaring you with personal computers which are number years old what we should be afraid of is laziness selfishness and entitlement which is all that ai technology and silicon valley has to sell
totally agree language is the most human thing
number agreed with all points aside from wearable technology cause that sounds very farfetched
as a german native the translation was perfectly understandable but appeared somewhat unnatural in a few places and the pronunciation felt slightly off too robotic
you would like to watch a scene from a scifi tvshow called quotstar trek discovery universal translator malfunctionquotbrthe quotuniversal translatorquot is a never wellexplained and neverconsistently used device that somehow makes people who talk vastly different languages to understand each other more details in memory alpha the wiki of star trek and multiple videosbrthe first and only time so far a malfunction of the universal translator has been portrayed was in that scene  and the person who saved the day was the only officer who had made the effort to learn languagesbrenjoy
currently english seems to be the defacto international language do you think ai will decrease the amount of people actually fluent in english as english learners rely more on ai to translate conversations for them
as speaker of chinese and german i would say that the ai generated speech is already good enough to deliver formal idea
i am learning chinese
hello paul you are addressing an extremely relevant topic herebrbrforeign languages are already hardly a part of the curriculum for most englishspeaking countries ai translations will simply help people beratebelittle and insult language geeks by saying quotwhy are you wasting time on learning french when you could be learning some much more useful stem subjectquotbrnon english speaking countries that are fighting to balance their budget could be striking foreign languages entirely to save money spent on educationbrbrthat said it will certainly be useful to be able to find a doctor and describe onenumbers symptons when visiting any country no matter the language brbrthe greatest challenge i see for ai is learning to deal with shades of meaning synonims and language registers including the speech levels typical of asian languages
i am azerbaijani and turkish and azerbaijani are very similar languages so i can speak and understand turkish perfectlyi think ai translated your speech perfectlybrpaul can you please make a video about azerbaijani
i am currently learning hawaiian in my free time therenumbers no way an ai at least for now and probably for a long time would be able to make a speech sound as natural as a native speaker could make chatgpt and google translate both create some weird sentences as well this all happens due to the fact that hawaiian content is meager it is hard to find good content for languages like hawaiian okinawan greenlandic basque etc it would need more work or maybe they wonnumbert even have any type of person working on them because the population of these languages is small anyway moreover languages are always evolving in every place some people might use some expressions more locally and come up with new expressions as a result an ai would need to follow this evolution
wow der deutsche teil hufrt sich unfassbar echt an
you should be more clear which dialect you mean when you say ucchineseud i donunumbert think itunumbers wise to marginalize other dialects
i already speak a few languages why stop now
iunumberm a professional translator and aside from short phrases or sentences automated translation like googe translate pretty much always require human revision so i think at least for a certain period of time human intervention is necessary to have the most accurate translation
i use ai a lot yet i continue to learn french slowly as well as enjoyment inumberm getting older and inumberm well aware i need to keep my brain active  use it or lose it having an ai do everything for me wonnumbert help me maintain my mental faculties i donnumbert speak french with anyone just yet but come retirement inumberll go and give some french people something to laugh at for sure
inumberm a language teacher and inumberve noticed that when the students who love the language theynumberre studying are the ones who really get ahead and they always prefer classes in person i believe human teachers make the learning process very personal and as a result more meaningful enjoyable and memorable ah and those students usually hate online lessons uf i havennumbert found until this day one student who liked online classes let alone learning with ai probably those who need to learn a language for work are more ok with that
inumberve been using chatgpt for numbertextingnumber in japanese itnumbers x times more effecient than hello talk responds right away and number accurate  not too mention you can customize gpts however you want mine provides a clear explanation correction and response to my prompts
an ai application can only be as good as the data would the training data include everything you would enjoy probably not unless itnumbers a personalized set of data that you can confirm the completeness so the wholesale llms wouldnnumbert and couldnnumbert replace number of language use the risk is when those llms make say number of language use number cheaper the remaining number use wouldnnumbert justify the much higher resource to invest and improve itnumbers like when cheap frozen chicken meat is vastly available then the majority would just take the deal and forget about raising their own chicken of course there will be people would know the savory taste of freshly prepared chicken meat and create its demand and market but for those who are born in a world of llms the number use would become niche that people would find difficult even remembering existed
ai will never eliminate the need to learn upper pelonian which no one currently speaks but pelonians and translate the bible into it almonian or elmonian and pelonian are placeholder languageethnicity names
as a native turkish speaker even though there were some minor mistakes in the translation it was pretty good and i am pretty surprised by it
i somewhat disagree ai will make easier to learn languages too letnumbers not forget that learning languages is difficult because of the current system that doesnnumbert want to move on from the way things were done in the past your classical text book in your school class when we finally move on from that into comprehensive input as a standard and ai helps us to enhance it which will also have itnumbers cost itnumbers not easy the act of learning a language will be enhanced too you have to look at demographics as well learning languages is good for who for the average middlemiddle upper class europeannorth american developed country person yes it has its benefits but this is more important for the migrants who want to change their lifestyle if they want to be assimilated the country itself will put the money needed to make the integration much faster and that includes language too it will be like that for various decades since itnumbers unlikely that countries like germany france or nordic ones are gonna be okey with just english for everything you have to adjust to the countrynumbers customs and that includes language yes i think language learning will change many activities will now be possible to be made with ai and thatnumbers awesome but the usefulness of a language goes beyond a job these days and the demographics just show that if developed countries want to survive and they are not having children at the rate they need to do sothey are gonna need to integrate the people from outside thatnumbers gonna carry a lot more than just language but as you can probably tell language is gonna be important donnumbert let anyone fool you big changes take time give it up from number to number years before thinking that we could truly discard learning a new language and thatnumbers still a longshot considering the demographic crisis in the developed world making language learning easier with ai will enhance the quantity and quality of qualified people entering the job markets of those countriesbrbralso as an added bonus for me the coolest stuff wenumberll get due to ai is finally a new standard for dubbing and subtitling for dubbed content i wanna learn a language with the content i love not just the content i have available in itnumbers origin form i wanna learn german with a japanese show dubbed in german but the dub itself doesnnumbert have a subtitle with the idioms of the german dubthatnumbers a big bother and the same goes for other dubs like arabic but thatnumbers for the future damn i envy my children already they are gonna have it much easier uf just imagine the automatic translations explanations of the grammar and context and natural audio with emotion all in one from even picking a physical book with those interesting looking glasses i want a model with the design of xmennumbers cyclops please ufe it will be easier guys we are assuming things will disappear from having a practical use but technology makes things easier to work around too itnumbers a new and interesting era and just like anyone else if you are worried about your labour stability we better get upgraded with the new tech and think of the ways in which we can use it to enhance our productivity inumberm already thinking of all the content i will be able to enjoy because of ai can you imagine merging lingopie with ai as a tech and language enthusiast inumberm extremely happy many boring tasks will disappear and i will be able to express my love for cultures and exchange much easier to my children because of ai too
i think learning new language than what you already know is a talent and whether or not ai is going to make it useless if a person is optimistic about learning language they will not derail themself from their track brfor me itnumbers always gonna be a no no i never gonna leave learning a language even when inumberll be busy with my works the little happiness after learning a language is very big for me and also after learning a language and observing it inumberm trying to make my own language and thatnumbers all i want different languages have different type of grammer sounds alphabets and thatnumbers also one of my favorite thing inumberm learning it anyway despite the fact that it will not gonna help me in anyway in my life or atleast in the next number year and those whonumberre upset about it just one thing to say  we do many thing in our life which is useless and many times we regret it but in this case np matter how useless this process is this is definitely not regretful
for anyone who actually enjoys the feeling of accomplishing learning a new language loves to see the progress of those neurons connecting in their brain and watching as nonesense sounds slowly become distinguishable speech no the idea that ai will kill said desire is a joke inumberd be much more worried if i were an artist or actor not to say ai is going to take those professions away any time soon or the joy of learning to draw or act for that matter
i still dislike ai for many reasons fastermore efficient isnunumbert always better weunumberre going to lose touch with much of our own humanity even speaking the language in business settings translating basic spanish and chinese to my foreign coworkers is a special human thing brbrwe keep pushing for things to get better without looking at how it can makes things worse i think a lot of this has to do with how depressed the recent couple generations are brbrmaybe iunumberm just a whiny grandpa
so star trek
excluding my native language english i study a little bit of four languages and a not very little bit of one and if there was no functional reason to learn a language inumberd definitely stop studying asl and spanish but inumberd still study tongva french and especially dutch i already only do because i want to and tongva is an extinct language anyway the ai cannumbert have any effect on my desire to learn those plus i imagine it will be quite a while before ai can completely take away any functional reason to learn a language donnumbert know though

good point about language learning for enjoyment sticking around there are lots of anime with plenty good english dubs but i choose japanese because i like it
will ai kill it absolutely not and imo you mention the most salient aspects as to why it will no happen interestingly enough it may lead to a decrease in the knowledge of the lingua franca of the moment currently of course english as it usually is not a passion project  just something you get through exposure and because of necessity brbras a professional simultaneous interpreter i expect my field to disappear at one point or another but really not in the near future the tech still simply isnnumbert good enough there are particularly two things that i see as major obstacles for ai to take over the field brbrfirstly speech isnnumbert perfect people eg mispronounce a lot and often leave things unsaid and the listener corrects and fills in or just take a sudden turn in the middle of a sentence additionally in some languages speakers never seem to put a full stop in their speech at all which absolutely does not comply with the rules of other languages add to that ia all the regional varieties and the differences between spoken and written language and i myself find it fairly hard to imagine that ai will soon get up to a sufficient level where it can cope with everything i have mentioned brbrsecondly and maybe more importantly the extralinguistic features of the speakers the same words of a sentence can be interpreted differently just on the basis of what the speakers emphasise or their tone as well as of their gestures and demeanour to be able to cope with this we really are going to need something much more than an ai that is more or less a mere translationinterpreting device it has to be a true intelligence

ai cannot replace learning local cultures and conventions and as you point out facetoface interactions are another order of activity than videos inumberm glad you also mentioned ancient languages ai cannot get into ancient languages and cultures with all their unknowns and ambiguities only a human mind can grapple with those
native turkish speaker and translator here while the translation wasnnumbert bad and it got the point across there were a couple errors that make it obvious this is a machine translation and the voice sounds a bit robotic as well but depending on the quotqualityquot expected by the client it could be good enough given time most companies could use a tool like this for most translations
the german created by the ai tool sounded a little bit electronic but the grammar was good
english speaker learning spanish and frenchlearning other languages is more than just word substitution because learning other languages is also learning different ways of thinking
i doubt ai will completely replace human translation particularly for dead languages i once tried to converse with chatgpt in anglosaxon and it was atrocious chatgpt invented words and endings every sentence had numerous mistakes i later tried it with latin and it was better but even then it still made up words
ai definitely make me forgot my turkish bruhh
thank you paul i totally agree with youbrbrinumberm learning welsh currently people often say itnumbers quotuselessquot because almost all welsh native speakers can speak perfect english or spanish if they are in patagonia but i still want to learn inumberm living in wales i love welsh culture and history i see the welsh people fighting for the destiny of the language i want to respect their efforts i want to talk to them in their native tongue rather than in english brbreven if nobody speaks a language so what itnumbers just peoplenumbers nerdy hobby learning a language makes me happy and makes many people happy does klingon have many speakers but itnumbers very important to star trek fans brbrby the way the invention of bikes cars and trains makes running much less functional but many people still love running
excellent video focus on human connection is key thatnumbers what makes my love for language learning tick something your video prompted me to ask myself can ai be used to preserve language diversity andor to document moribund languages
even if greedy corporations will probably use robots to make work harder to obtain and  or sustain i think artificial intelligence will stimulate a new wave of desire for the human element of interaction and consumption i learn arabic for example out of a desire for spiritual advancement  and thatnumbers something a robot cannot have a soul furthermore i learn hindi  urdu collectively hindustani to be versed in the language of my ancestors and my folks back home in bihar india
why do people still draw and paint when they can just as easily take a photograph why do people continue to read and write books when we have tv and movies therenumbers so much more to the experience of language learning that the practical application for a lot of us the journey is its own reward
now inumberm number sure you are an ai it doesnnumbert make you less awesome though
it is without a doubt that ai will eventually be so adept at translation to the point where every human translator gets replaced by an ai one
br
brnevertheless translation is inherently an imperfect process wherein the transfer of information from one language to another seldom occurs without alterations a striking illustration of this phenomenon is the challenge posed by definite articles such as englishnumbers quotthequot arabicnumbers quotalquot and portuguesenumbers quotoquot when translated into languages lacking definite articles such as chinese russian or turkish these linguistic nuances often become obscured or omitted
br 
branother example lies in languages with perfect tenses consider the phrase quotwill have eatenquot in english which can be relatively straightforward to translate into spanish due to the existence of future perfect tenses in both languages however this ease of translation becomes less apparent when dealing with languages like tagalog which lacks an equivalent future perfect tense in such cases conveying the precise temporal nuances inherent in the english expression becomes a more intricate task requiring careful consideration of alternative linguistic structures and expressions in the target language this highlights the unique challenges posed by specific linguistic features that may not have direct counterparts across diverse language systems
br
brkorean honorifics present yet another challenge in translation these linguistic conventions deeply embedded in the fabric of korean communication carry subtle nuances of respect and formality that may not have direct equivalents in other languages such as english as a result the intricacies of honorifics may be lost or inadequately conveyed during the translation process
br
brfurthermore humor particularly in the form of jokes constitutes a fascinating dimension of linguistic expression it is a wellestablished observation that jokes often lose their intended humor and cultural resonance when translated the play on words cultural references and linguistic nuances that make a joke amusing in one language may not seamlessly transition to another language leading to a loss of comedic impact
br
brthe points mentioned above are but a few examples that underscore the inherent complexities and limitations in translation processes ranging from the nuances of definite articles to the challenges posed by perfect tenses honorifics and the delicate art of humor these intricacies highlight that to fully grasp the richness of a culture relying solely on translation may not be the most effective approach instead a more comprehensive understanding emerges through direct language acquisition learning the language yourself not only enhances your ability to navigate linguistic subtleties but also provides invaluable insights into the cultural nuances that shape communication therefore while ai continues to advance in translation capabilities the depth of cultural understanding achieved through language learning remains unparalleled

as a native speaker of german that sounded really close to how people would speak a bit off but very close
paul younumberre seriously one of my favourite youtubers ever i look nowhere else when i want some info on any language amazing job as always
languages are amazing and ai could never cover every subtle detail therenumbers in a language neither how exciting it is to dicover  learn and assimilate them itnumbers a personal experience
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera iunumberm a native mandarin speaker the aitranslated speech is generally fine but it is still different from what a native speaker would say and just gives out a foreign vibe like apple commercials in chinabralso the pronunciation is a bit weird regarding its rhythm and tones but i think thatunumbers a general problem for texttospeech systems
i was shocked to learn just yesterday that a dutch man inumberd thought bilingual in english really isnnumbert i wrote to ask him a question and he answered that he couldnnumbert answer because his translator app couldnnumbert handle my wording
i mean the german part was understandable but if you said quotor if i want to create a video that goes viral in germany and austriaquot  this is not exactly what the ai said it should have said quotoder wenn ich ein video erstellen will dass in deutschland und udsterreich viral geht oder gehen wird kann ich es in deutsch ufcbersetzenquot it kind of cut off the part quotor if i wantquot i mean you can still kind of get what is being said but the first sentence is not complete
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera very very true literally me i love the experience of acquiring new information from another language btw you watch indonesian news woah inumberm shocked that younumberre updated with our situation right now the president election for number
ai cannot solve the fundamental problem of translation intranslatibility because it is unsolvable translation is an art not a science ai will not make language learning obsolete  in the same way that even when books are available in translation you will always find people willing to learn a language in order to enjoy them in their original version
i think younumberre right paul but the language learning market will shrink dramatically and thatnumbers bad news for teachers
at most learning another language will be a simply a matter of personal pride and development but even that will be a long time in the future ais that can reliably interpret one language to another donunumbert exist yet and it will be a long time before they are common enough to make learning new languages and cultures impractical
thank you for this paul inumberm a bit of a language geek myself and you have always inspired me even though younumberre an admitted introvert if i were to ever run into you at a polyglot event i would introduce myself and thank you personally best of wishes for more language adventures
french arennumbert you canadian
there always will be immigrants who need to learn local languages there will be people who want to learn globally used languages such as english since their mother tongue is germanrussianjapaneseetc and there will always be people who think that chineseturkishitalianetc sound cool and are fond of foreign culture 
good language video paul you are the best ufe
the ai may not destroy the language learning but surely will kill the dubbing industry
when i try to speak spanish with a native spanish speaker the reaction is always uccringe dude just speak englishud
turkish translation is really good not just grammar or vocabulary but also intonation and accent it is not perfect though yet younumberd have study turkish for a decade to do it better than the ai
language learning is all about passion there will be people who learn languages for instrumental purposes but the richness you get from communicating in different languages and the knowledge you get from different cultures are pricelessbrgreat vid as always

inumberm a native mandarin speaker yes inumberm very impressed i think it imitates how nonnative people tried to learn chinese the tone is somewhat unnatural and a little robotic when it says quotzhong guo renquot chinese people itnumbers a very typical or stereotypical foreign accent but overall the tone is very good the grammar is flawless if a nonnative speaker can speak mandarin like this i would say quotyour mandarin is perfectquot
that is crazy paul is going to take all our jobs turkish was almost perfect except for one small mistake in parallelism in tense in translation of uche doesnunumbert speak turkishud it had to be uche is not speaking turkishud to sound right in turkish
wow here i was wondering for a while if inumberll ever see a video a video on ai vs language learning great bygones are the days where people say quotsorry for bad language i helped myself with google translatequot no now itnumberll be quothi i am fluent in language even in a b and c inumberll even put that on my cv bcz f you also if you ask me to talk to you in language face to face well f you i donnumbert owe you any proof aka chat gpt will numberwritenumber for me and some audio ai will numberspeaknumber for mequotbrbrthis is this is litterally the same case scuenario as ai genrating images at this point a true detriment to actually learning a skill and an propeller for enabling laziness a general derriment to quotbeing curiousquot really why all that whatnumbers the point of having an ai do this for you
ai video didnnumbert seems natural
i totally agree with your analysis the pleasure i derive from learning speaking reading and listening to other languages will never be provided by ai translation all that this new technology can do is send me back to my native language so whatnumbers the fun of it
honestly i was waiting for you to make a video on this topic since the day i came across this ai tool itnumbers like a real linguist finally coming face to face with an ai linguistuf
ucufef
very interesting video i donnumbert think language learners need to fear the development of ai any time soon humans can give things meaning and interpret that meaning in many ways whereas ai can only mimic patterns and know what patterns look like be it a novel an essay and even facial expressions our individual uses of languages like slang and the unique connections of multilingual speakers make between their languages cannot be replicated easily
i will personally never use these automatic translation tools unless itnumbers mandatory at work
as a turk i can say that the turkish voice of ai was funny and good
love the way you teach and explain your points youunumberre funny but does not distract from the information you convey thank you
if the turkish and german natives were impressed by the ai results then i think language learning will become more of a niche interest as functional needs are taken care of by better iterations of ai to those who say it wonnumbert replace dialects and localisations i would counter by asking how long a learner needs to get beyond functionality and to use idiom and dialect fluidly most will never get to that point
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera what you say here paul hits very close to home i am american but learned how to speak portuguese and spanish i founded an imports business in number i import mostly handcrafted items from latin america knowing the languages of my destination countries  and something about their cultures  has bridged the gaps and brought me closer to the people inumberve done business with this is something not taught in business school i have an mba i have had numerous instances where people felt honored that i would care enough to learn their language i wish i had a lempira a peso or a real for every time someone said to me something like quotof all the other americans who have come down here you are the only one to speak to us in our languagequot and next year i celebrate number years in business i feel that bridging the gap through language has had a lot to do with the longevity of my business please people donnumbert lean on ai for everything
inumberm a native german speaker and the german one seemed less ai than you speaking english uf
interesting videobras a professional translator here are my two centsbri use machine translators like deepl or google translate in the same way that a driver uses their gps system  it can speed up my work by giving me prompts but there are two big quotbutsquotbrfirstly at least in my usual language combination those systems can be okish at very simple texts but they flounder when the text has any level of complexity using them to generate texts that i would then postedit would not be viable for me it simply takes more time and effort than actually doing a translation those systems will eventually remove lowend translators from the market  those translators who spew out large quantities of poorquality text for low prices clients simply wonnumbert pay that when they could get a text of equally poor quality from a machine translator for a lot less frankly those translators wonnumbert be missedbrsecondly and this is the huge elephant in the room for the developers of machine translation systems  their capabilities improved dramatically when the neural network model replaced the old statistical type but i use these systems daily in my work and at least in my usual language combination over about the past three years the quality has plateaunumberd if you spell it like that  it looks a bit weird but never mind i keep hearing that the systems will keep on getting better but for threeish years they simply havennumbert progressed in any noticeable way in my own professional experience that is the reality regardless of what the developers try to claim in various quotstudiesquot with extremely questionable methodology the technology seems to have hit a glass ceilingbrmaybe a complete paradigm shift will come and revolutionise the technology again  itnumbers certainly possible but i suspect that if it does it will bring such massive and shocking changes to every single area of human life that the question of how good ai is at language learning and translation will seem entirely unimportant compared with the existential challenges that humanity will facebranyway love your videos keep up the good work
iunumberm a native speaker of chinese the chinese translation was pretty good however i was actually confused it meant something like ucthey may find my level of fluency memorableud but the flow of speech was not so fluent and the choice of words was not natural it sounded like a robot the first time i heard it i thought you mean ucthe lack of fluency which is a level of fluency is memorableud i was genuinely confused
i was like wtffff i have a hangover and am lying in bed all of a sudden i hear this and forget about all my sickness turkish sounds perfect without any accent i am scared
crowd sourcing i deal with youtube videos in hebrew and palestinian arabic of people speaking in informal speech can anyone recommend specific software to translate speech into english subtitles better if it can also focus on people speaking when therenumbers a lot of background noise for hebrew what inumberve found is soso for palestinian arabic software cannumbert understand arabic dialects
i donunumbert think an ai would look that tired uf love you dude
turkish you sounded roboticbrchinese and german sounded more natural or it is just because these languages have certain patterns of stops when they are spoken your voiced changed in these two
imo ai language will be used by media and tourist especially by americans who cant bother to learn another language everyone else will do like theynumberve always done
i could easily understand the language problems in your turkish back in the days but since for few years turkish is loosing its own spirit cause of immigration problems here in istanbul so your ai translate is better then new istanbul dialect
for me as a dutchman your german sounds soulles via ai
i think the ai tools could significantly decrease the amount of people who learn a language based on my own experience with language learning i could say that motivation is divided into number groupsbr  hard motivation you move to another country and you need to communicate at workshophospital etc or you know that good english communication skills could increase your salary and give you an advantage in the job marketbr soft motivation you like the language in general you want to learn a new culture you want to communicate with people about nonwork topics make new friends etcbrbrai could fill all your needs in the hard motivation group so you would have much less motivation to learn it unless you are enjoying the process in general and i think most of people just quit it because it takes time and money
german audio lacks reverberations it feels off

the translation into chinese is better than an average language learner but is still kind of bad in both grammar and pronunciation it will probably take some specialized patch to make it betterbrthe problem of the current generation of ai is that it takes some time to train and requires wellparametrized data so it cannot capture the spontaneous changes of cultures or less documented phenomenons bralso it probably cannot translate languagespecific punsphrases and get their meaning across well just like human translators i have deep understanding of two languages and i can say while translation can get most of the meanings across they miss something big all the time at this time when ai translation is still mostly on par with human translations i donnumbert think it is the time to say ai can kill language learning
the tones of the passage in chinese are a little weird but the words are generally understandableunumber
that software translation thing is kinda fascinating
take ai into the middle of a field and give it eternal rest  brbrseriously if ai can assist in providing practice for listening and speaking especially correct speaking of a new language by all means use ai to create studentai conversations the ai should be able to calculate consistent errors in pronunciation and usage provided it clearly identifies a real mistake and to provide that help to the student as practice short conversations outside of classbrbrquot outside of classquot yes the fact is that ai should not replace the teacher but rather assist the student and teacher by providing the quotnumber hours a dayquot practice that twoset violin claim are necessary to master any skill consider learning could be as much as number hours a week class time that is costly for almost anyone but that could be accomplished with free student effort ahem much better than with books recordings to listen to but not interact with etcbrbrone warning is that the ai which could reasonably simulate a conversation similar to that of a turning test  it should be constrained from getting too personal how that is accomplished represents the next step in language learning
what about the possibility of ai assisting us in creating even more languages i think that would also be a fun hobby
as a person who has been learning turkish for a year and can speak very fluently that was pretty impressive
ai will not be able to perfectly translate languages for a while and when we eventually get there it will be a far bigger deal than just translation since in order to perfectly translate you need to have a theory of mind be able to understand social dynamics understand and take into account context etc this is no longer a language model but an artificial general intelligence for people who are unfamiliar with the term there are two types of ai narrow and general narrow is every type of ai we currently have they are not truly intelligent but are able to simulate it for a narrow range of tasks general ai on the other hand is essentially an artificial human intelligence for all intents and purposes these ais are going to affect far more than just language learning also at the end of the day untranslatables will always be a motivating factor for learning a language to steal an example from tom scott shakespeare cannot be properly translated into french since the format of his writings rely on a feature of english that french simply does not have or a personal goal of mine is to read the monogatari series in japanese since it relies heavily on untranslatables
the printing press didnnumbert kill writing tv didnnumbert kill books games didnnumbert kill tv etcbrpeople will always be interested in languages
great video and i agree with many of these sentimentsbrbron another note would you be interested in doing a video on the macanese creole language it has fewer than number speakers these days but recently inumberve learned it to a certain degree and also started analyzing its grammar and morphology i even translated a poem into macanese for fun let me know what you think
this means inumberll be able to speak to people in latin and be understood
inumberm becoming iaphobic
native german speaker here and for me it sounds very robotic the grammar is completely correct but it doesnnumbert really sound natural like a native speaker
the german was kinda good but you can feel itunumbers artificial a bit robotic
this video makes a good point but another youtuber inumberm subscribed to has a friend making an app to teach languages using ai so it can go either way
i feel somehow that culturespecific key elements of the dialogue will get lost in translation
im from germanybrwell i can say that this was not really you bc how quotyouquot spoke but actually it was pretty good and nearby the reality would be cool to see a video in which you speak german xd
absolutely yes in terms of communication everyone will be able to communicate easily
it will just accelerate learning eventually and make learning very accessible
i remember the first time i talked to a french native speaker it was just a phone call but i was thrilled nevertheless ia cannumbert replace that feeling
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera and also for cognitive development
your question quotwill you still dedicate time to learning and practicing other languages if ai translation makes it unnecessary quotbrmy answer  yes i will because it is intellectually stimulating
language geeks of the world unite lol
your cyborg ai version on thumbnail looked like david draiman xdxd
realtime turkish was pretty good not like native speakers but very close to a foreigner speaking turkish
as someone that only speaks one language the idea of total communication does sound quite intriguing a tech version of the babel fishbrbras long as it could be turned off i donnumbert need to hear ai dubbing ruining all my favourite japanese shows if something can give automatic accurate subtitles that would be amazing instead
very interesting that you posted this video i never considered this reality uf i love your point about the point of language learning people uninterested in languages donunumbert really seem to understand why we actually study languages itunumbers very rarely for work or a resume uf itunumbers for fun and mental challenge
if european portuguese sound like russian then brazilian portuguese sounds like lithuanian and thatnumbers coming from a latvian the only way i can distinguish is by picking out words that i can recognize
language learning is already dead it just doesnnumbert know it yet brhohohohouf meowww uf
as a native speaker of english inumberve never needed to learn anything else and thatnumbers just a fact ai translation tools wonnumbert change that in any meaningful way ill continue to learn for the same reasons i do now itnumbers fun and i like surprising people
many reasons to learn a language i love learning hebrew as i love it i am jewish and so it feels like my language and it is the language of holy text well ancient hebrew is its just fun to learn language and culture
ucueubueunumberunumberunumber ufueub
you have a great point at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera the experience of someone getting excited that you can speak their language can never be replaced no matter how advanced technology gets inumberve experienced it a few times with french even though my french really isnnumbert the greatest theynumberll appreciate any earnest attempt brbrwell done in presenting both sides of this argument and yes your ai translation into german sounded very stiff and formal
the turkish seemed quotgoodquot because there were no mistakes but they way you spoke seemed off no one speaks like that in real life
artificial intelligence probably wonnumbert replace absolutely everything because politicians know that once artificial intelligence takes away all our jobs then that will lead to angry voters sitting in their house with nothing else to do except to vote pro artificial intelligence politicians out of political office at the election booths most likely artificial intelligence will replace some jobs because some rich business people want more money but more politicians will prevent artificial intelligence from taking every job as they need to secure votes from voters
ok that video translation software you demonstrated was kinda scary
this is such a cool technology  inumberm amazed at the video but i think an overlooked impact will be that it will againmore privilege large languages while minority languages and signed languages will fall by the wayside therenumberll be languages that are technologically privileged and thus gain more traction and use worldwide and languages that stay in their own bubble pushed further out of the reach of the average person media etc
would be nice to see these tools used to help preserve endangered languages in a way that would make it accessible for people to learn interactively
ai if applied correctly could actually improve the languagelearning experience things like autocorrect for grammar and even pronunciation for example deepl write is an early attempt at that although it currently only works for two englishes us amp uk and standard german another thing could be something like the early versions of memrise that is an ai creating mnemonics for you to remember when younumberre struggling to create your own and thatnumbers just off the top of my mindbrbrof course we still have to wait until techbros are done playing and real professionals can finally take the stage to use the technology in a sensible way
language learning is so profoundly fulfulling i wonnumbert ever stop
iunumberm really not all that impressed by ai translations theyunumberre incredibly bad at translating different levels of formalinformal speech take an italian text that uses unumbertuunumber translate it into french and it wonunumbert use french unumbertuunumber literally the same word but rather unumbervousunumber which is much more formal you will get the gist of whatunumbers being said but youunumberll suddenly feel like youunumberre talking to some government agent rather than a potential friend
the german pronunciation sounded artificial and the text didnnumbert hit your usual register
turkish translation was very accurate and pronounciation is also good
i was shocked hearing the turkish onebri was thinking it was you speakingbronly for example was translated as urne which need to be said as urnak brwhich also isnnumbert a good translation itnumbers better to say masalabrbut all the other sentences were good
the german ai translation sounds exactly like the translations used by scammers so people wonunumbert trust you
i speak on behalf of turkish the translation is incredibly good if i didnnumbert know the tone of your voice and saw a video of yours for the first time i would definitely think you were a foreigner who later learned turkish as his native language ofc it isnunumbert localised it but perfect for formal conversations
can ai help decipher ancient unread script
the turkish and german were really good but the intonation was a bit off like too monotone if that shit works in real time wow
ai will help you to learn hw to speak foreign tonguesin your own voiceand not sound like duolingo or the voice on the language tape it will show you how to mouth as if looking into a mirror of the future bring it on bayarlala ngiyabonga
the german parts are perfect in the words itself like they are number perfect but the pitch of the sentences itself doesnt feel right its a bit quotroboticquot like number words number words number words the structure of the breaks feels falsebrbut if i hear that without context i would never guess ai its to good for that i would think quotwtf is he speaking like that is he reading a telepromter or whatquot xd
i donunumbert think ai will ever replace the need for personal fluency for fields agents of intelligencecounterintelligence government agencies for reasons that should be pretty obvious i also donunumbert think that the need for language learning instruction will completely go away as long as countries require some degree of fluency to avoid some kind of tower of babel situation if the technology ever fails totally agreed on the other personal reasonsbrone upshot of ai might be the possibility of preserving endangered but not critically endangered indigenous languages if thereunumbers no longer a huge sense of pressure to learn or communicate in english or another lingua franca and these languages can be used to to communicate with anyone there might be a resurgence in their use at least in some communities where the technology is readily available
im fluent in portuguese spanish and english is my third language people using tech divises in order to translate stuff will never feel that satisfaction of understand something you really studied hard for i can listen to music now that i used to listen when i was a child with the diference that now i can understand every single word that feeling that you can understand something you used to struggle with just using your brain is something no tech devise can provide
i agree that ai translators will probably be something that we see in workplaces but wonnumbert replace human curiosity in college i took mandarin classes because i was fascinated by chinese culture and wanted to learn the language now inumberm starting to learn a little aramaic in my spare time because that was jesusnumbers native tongue in neither case do i expect to get any practical benefits from learning these languages but i think learning them is still good for my mental health
i think that in the future as soon as language learning loses a lot of its importance those who speak other languages will perhaps be more valorized like someone who could just wear glasses which translates our languages automatically to each other chose to learn and delve deeper into my language and culture i would prefer that to the mechanical way
i think that the world will start to move in the direction of most native english speakers ie language learning is only done when truly needed or wanted because of englishnumbers status as the primary global link language the average anglophone doesnnumbert really need to learn another language the tools paul described will likely serve a similar purpose for most of the world
never language learning is a skill that helps develop communicative abilities and logical emotional and cultural thinking the one whonumbers able to speak more than one language knows that it means freedom you donnumbert need to rely on machines computers etc you have it and no one can take it from you
i actually feel like ai will help all sorts of learning inumberve been using it for coding mostly but also for some grammar questions and the great thing about it is that it can work like asking a teacher you can give specific parameters for a question and get a detailed stepbystep answerbri think it does pose a danger to the job of the language teacher and the translator as it can to translations very quick and without the mistakes you used to typically see when people use google translate or or dictionariesbrbrwith inflation being on the up and up for the foreseeable future my guess is that a lot of people will prefer ai tools to actual people as itnumbers likely to be cheaper by comparison even if it lacks the social aspect that is also conducive to learning
i studied latin and ancient greek in school and i also learned sardinian just because it was the language of my ancestors so no i donnumbert think inumberll stop learning languages just because of ai if anything aiaided learning programs will be a way to get input much more immersively than a traditional textbook or application like duolingo
cool premier
ai could help us to learn languaged assuming that it is able to make no mistakes english for example is becoming a meaningless drivel
listening to the german part i can state that itnumbers consistently high german without any regional accent using a regional accent is something a native speaker does automaticly and thus giving you a hint about where exactly heshe is from ai wonnumbert  unless itnumbers trained to mimic a certain accent regional accents spoken by people from that region are something only real human to human communication can provide for me these accents are a big part of what makes a language interesting
woaaah

in order to compete with ai governments across the globe should consider the idea of making teaching foreign languages a compulsory part of their education system where for example spanish should be taught from preschool until college in the philippines and the united states
language models may be good at learning but the lifecycle of slang in the age of the internet is like trying to chase roadrunner going at light speed and some slang is so multilayered or becomes so multilayered that it may unumberconfuseunumber it
thanks a lot finally paul notices this
no because i learned languages to connect with people
now bthatnumbersb a thumbnail
personally when i learn a language most of the words i learn come from a teacher however i also believe that google translate would probably be better off as a dictionary for single words or short phrases and i occasionally use it to try and improve my vocabulary
the only thing itnumbers gonna kill is art just like autotune killed singing
well as a professional language tutor i already feel like inumberve been automated away by ai  because no one hires me anymore even though inumberm clearly great at my job and used to be quite successful and i assume itnumbers because everyone has flocked to free automated learning resources and while my heart is happy that language learning is no longer gated behind having money my wallet and my paranoia about misinformation being potentially taught frequently by automated resources is kinda peeved at this heh
i donunumbert even need to watch the video to know the answer no ai may augment the language learning processunumberdramatically in fact but it canunumbert kill the invaluable humantohuman connection that actually learning someone elseunumbers native language affords

hiwhat version chatgpt you use 
terima kasih
so  is every language actually represented in chat gpt no  not really even the languages that are represented are not equally representedbrbrand really  do you need chatgpt to give you a study plan of number minutes a daybrbralso  frequency lists can only be generated from the training data  for lesser represented languages those frequency lists may not be as useful  and learning only highfrequency words is not the best way to learn vocabulary note number words is not a very large vocabulary itnumbers not even enough to complete cefr a for either french or english finally  there are a ton of vocabulary lists already created for anki that you can already download  not sure what chat gpt is adding herebrbrthe spoken language does not sound natural at all  the french was  really bad russian too  and that was just numberhellonumberbrbrand we can see how poorly it detects your speechbrbrthis imighti get you some basics but itnumbers not going to get you fluent especially not in a rarer language note  only about number languages are supported on chatgpt  so that is limiting right there hope you arennumbert interested in any african languagesbrbra hrefhttpsbotpresscombloglistoflanguagessupportedbychatgpthttpsbotpresscombloglistoflanguagessupportedbychatgptabrbrperhaps consider interacting with an actual human speaker of your target language there are a lot of resources for that there are also a lot of free resources available that will get you through a in pretty much any language you are interested in if you want better than that a decent target for numberfluencynumber is b you will probably want to use resources that will cost money inumberm not saying it is impossible to get there entirely through selfstudy from only free materials but it will be faster and easier with at least one other human in the mix who speaks as good or better than your target level and who can explain what is going on linguistically on the fly
haha donnumbert hang out with your friends and join a cult got it
these are just tips and require a lot of thinking but require no commitment however you can use them as extra tools

there seems to be nothing you can do to have it slow itnumbers chat down i have tried asking it and it only does it a couple of rates slower i find it is still far to quick
gran bel video grazie credo che siamo solo allunumberinizio di un percorso che renderue sempre piuf facile apprendere nuovi linguaggi cunumberue chi auspica addirittura che non sarue nemmeno piuf necessario farlo ma dove sarebbe poi il divertimento uf
yes i totally agree you can learn a language with ai immersive translate will help you choose a search engine such as deepl chatgpt and gemini it also translates pdfs and other texts free of charge
how do i get it to talk back i am only getting typed responses i can talk to it using my mic thank you
i am norwegian jeg er norsk
i tried it and it sucks too complicated to actually create something senseful at your level of language it cant really pronounce words correctly it pronounces french words with english pronunciation
great videobrwhy did you choose the north korean flag on the thumbnail to represent the korean language
i have never met anybody who spoke a language fluently by learning it from ai however it is a very useful tool for language learning
where are those settings located a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjwtvrraaamptnumbernumbernumbera are those gpt settings bc i cannumbert find them on the iphone
great video thank you so much the information was wonderful it is much appreciated keep up the good work
just discovered your channel liked and subscribed i will be attempting to learn conversational french in number weeks and really hoping this will give me a great start

how can i change the language accent on chatgpt it is talking to me in italian with english accent
do u need chatgtp plus for the voice chat feature or is it not available on android
the chatgptnumbers mistakes happen because the ai translate every thing to one language
ueueudunumberunumber wondering is that the free or paid version somebody with access to chatgpt can tell me if paid there are other apps that are build on top of chatgpt for language learners yourteacherai talkpal languatalk gliglish gopenpal and a few more
quotjoin a cultquotbrthis looks like a plan to me
chat gpt is not free nothing else to say
i donnumbert get it did you talk to chat gpt or what was it if yes how can i install the same extension to communicate with chat gpt for language learning thanks
i need have gpt or i can do the same with gptnumber
the french pronunciation of the ai was not the best spanish was perfect it sounded very much like a bilingual native englishspanish speaker reading french text with a basic understanding of the pronunciation
i speak tamil
what platform do you use to have conversations are you using a specific chat gpt plugin
why does norwegian sound like sim talk
inumberm trying to practice spanish but when the computer talks it sounds very numbergringonumber por favor sounds numberpour faveornumber instead of numberpor fahvoornumber is there any way you can make chat gpt fix this so inumberm not learning bad habits
tried this today and i am loving the ai back and forth conversation it feels like inumberm talking with a real person and i need consistent practice throughout the day to become fluent

one of the great things you can ask chat gpt is to include the numbernumber spaces between the norwegian and english vocab list it means you can easily cover the screen on one side and memorise the opposing words
this seems so complicated uf
a step forward one issue is when itunumbers talking you canunumbert see the text which would help

inumberve been testing and it has some flawsbrbrthe best thing about it is it can generate some word quiz that you can try to answerbrbror as a translator at least it can do multiple translations at once i learn french and spanish and when i use a normal translator i have to manually change the language options to go back and forth between french and spanish but i can ask chatgpt to translate it to french amp spanish at the same timebrbrguess translator apps should be worried by this ai brbrand the flaws are  it doesnnumbert have a builtin speaker that sounds like native some translatorlanguage learning apps have better speakers in translator app you can at least replayrelisten again in slow speedbrbritnumbers good for some of my needs but i still wouldnnumbert recommend this to people who seriously wants to learn languages there are apps out there designed for language learning that included ai technologybrbrjust not free uf

this is so funny that you made this video as i have started using chatgpt to help improve my norwegian the written component is crazy strong but as you said the pronunciation is wonky i wonder if they are working on that i would find it particularly interesting if they could develop it far enough that it could also coach a person on pronunciation i really like the ability to ask questions in norwegian and have it correct my norwegian and explain what i did wrong

been using many things to learn languages once this is more accurate that is a solid way of teaching as far as how productive its good for conversations i asked for a stimulation and i gave the ai an age and background and occupation then if i got stuck in practicing language i asked how to to say quotblankquot in target language and it explained in english then switched to target language to include in dialogue only thing if you want learn things slowly its not for you ai lists things incredibly fast it only slows down if in simulation conversation i am impressed might actually get chatgpt plus now i am convinced

the main problem is that it will start talking back even if you just have a tiny pause between your sentences it should wait longer or be better at knowing when you are finished talking
really cool vid takk ufa i have been learning swedish for quite a long time didnnumbert start with chatgpt though but lately i use it and ask it to write me short stories in swedish ufa or even talk about music and movies in swedish with chatgpt  i still stick to youtube for grammar analysis and explanations ufa and i try to read literature ebooks and listen to podcasts in order to expand my vocabulary and listening skills since i live in greece greek mother tongue it is not that easy to find people to practice speaking the trick you showed on the video i had no idea we could use chatgpt to practice speaking actually thanks a lot ufaufa

hi andy i commondeered someone elses language prompt and generalised it so u can learn any language i also reduced it to syntax so its only number characters and you can finetune it how u want it note that the first response we will get sounds weird only because we havnt chosen a language yet and its translating nothing but once we choose one it works great il leave the prompt in a reply to this one for easy copy paste

itnumbers an excellent way for learning vocabulary systematically however pronunciation is everything i hope there will be a tool in future to do this similar to the language tools that already exist

it pronounce foreign languages with a strong english accent tho kinda like google assistant doesbrbrthe fix is probably having multiple textspeech languages in the software that automatically switch when asked

i think ai is an excellent tool to learn a different language inumberve been trying to learn hebrew and i donnumbert have anyone to talk to except for friends on zoom who also want to practice nothing is perfect though i went to a zoom meeting today and it was more about bonding in english than practicing hebrew not all meetings are created equal if i can talk to ai and say for exampleinumberm worried about the economy and it answeres quotthe american economy is sound there are lots of jobs out therequot ok i want to talk more about that but i want to hear it again and again before i expound more deeply on the subject my friends on zoom would not tolerate so much repeats they would throw me out of the group ai would not

as an english teacher myself i must say i found your video to be incredibly captivating especially when you highlighted the possibility of language learners engaging in conversations with chatbots however one concern that arises is the level of meaningfulness in such interactions it brings to mind the analogy of chess despite the fact that computer chess games possess intricate techniques and delve into greater depths than any human chess game they tend to receive less attention from spectators chess enthusiasts instead find more significance in watching two human players engage in a match rather than witnessing a battle between two computers
very useful many thanks indeed
i use chatgpt to practice my languages often i just ask chat gpt to practice spanish for instance with me and correct me on major mistakes and it will hold a conversation with me and ask engaging questions for as long as i want brbryou know voice to text and text to voice already exists itunumbers on my iphone keyboard itunumbers not far off to think someone can just add transcription for my voice to go from voice to text and then dictation for chat gpt to go from text to voice and then add a fake cgi face and boom you have a language tutor that you can practice with with unlimited time youunumberre talking and itunumbers interacting and talking about in your target language brbrvery soon someone will do this mark my words

brunumber
br
branyway the point is it is useful for ai uf as it is modular and easy to start learning it can also be used as a reference for understanding common human languages uf
i mean you can use ai to generate completely original stories containing vocabulary or other linguistic parameters that you want to learn or to drill for example i use openai and i can instruct it to generate for example a onehundred word story including the terms quotcatquot quotnewsreaderquot and quotflight of stairsquot as well as any other high or low frequency words and various tenses or conventions that i tell it to
we were born the same day maybe thatnumbers way i love your videos so much you do always a great job for all of us
hey steve what do you think of using chatbot gptnumber from openai its an language model which is trained on tb of text in all kind of languages you can tell it for example to write its responses as an child or if you have a character based language like japanese to put the reading behind parenthesis would this be revolutionary as an language learning tool
the fasted way to become bconversationalb in ianyi language is immersion period like a baby listens to their parents language long before they ever start speaking themselves reading writing grammar etc are learned iafteri becoming minimally conversationalbrbras a nonothing beginning newsecond language learner  i think when attempting to speak a language with a native speaker then they look at you with disdain  unworthy of their consideration it really hurts thus the key is either get the courage to develop a thick skin or find a patient compassionate partner i have a hard time finding a patient compassionate partner and i am human enough not a sociopath to accept that rejection is deeply disheartening brbrthis is where ai fits if i can spend time with an ai audio chatbot as a beginner learning first the basic and most often used words and phrases and being corrected in my pronunciation until it is at least understandable not perfect or flawless this would go a long way to boost initial confidence ai never gets tired or frustrated with a lack of progress i would be able to converse in perhaps number words or more comfortably the ai audio bot would work to help me crawl before i attempt to walk at some point i would matriculate into real human based conversation interactions  with ifar less feari of embarrassment and humiliation moreover my human language partner counterpart wouldnnumbert get so quickly exhausted in attempting to diagnose what i am quottryingquot to say brbrai should be that first number word and number phrase learning platform again no need at all for perfection just a level of pronunciation equivalent to someone speaking with a thick accent it is the kindergarten class which elevates the learners biconfidence in learningib more than the learning itself that is so important at the beginning
the open ai audio to text app is actually the best tool if you want to have a good transcription

knowing thatnumbers only on the edge of ai but i find the text to speech so good in the web version of lingq that i now make numbernumber minutes lessons consisting of sentences and words inumberm having trouble withor have just recently come across i often take sentences and words in emails from friends or short things i find online or from lingq lessons from my tutors and just add them to a google doc or google translate i make sure to have period at the end of every sentence or word i often repeat the hardest words sometimes before or after the sentence then when i have numbernumber minutes of content just make new lingq lesson with these wordssentencesand ask lingq to autogenerate the audio i cannumbert speak for all languages but in hebrew itnumbers amazing not sure inumberd want to listen to a whole story or long article this way but for review and newinteresting sentences with lots of new words it works great
wenumberre not there yet because itnumbers still too slow for now but i envision an ai which in realtime draws an image of the sentenceparagraph giving one a direct and immediate visual of what was said or writtenbrbrfor now we can tie a translator to an ai image service like midjourneystable diffusion but it takes a few minutes per image normally and needs work to optimize the outputs for this particular usecase but technologynumbers rate of improvement is still exponential 
this channel deserves a more than million subscribers this is the only learning language topic that i follow up thanks mr kaufmann i have a question is google translate homepage is appropriate and suitable for a beginner to learn a new language because the teachers in the courses that i took doesnunumbert allow me to do it what are other sources besides google translate do you recommend then appreciate your help
wow happy birthday steve nice shirt
parabuens pra vocuea mr kaufmann ufeuff bri started on my own by daily discipline an inmersive methodology to practice french due to the fact that i had done a short summer interchange cultural course many years ago and by not putting it into practice forgot quite almost of it but u know some fun facts that happens to me is that i gain accent quickly manner and after been for such many years not speaking my native language pt some of the less useful words i tend to forget and find myself trying to explain within a context to express myself sometimes uf
many comments welcome ai but iunumberm curious how many people here would want to have a computer chip such as neurolink imbedded into their brain to greatly increase their abilities to learn and obtain any information such as language
happy birthday steve for number that is still young nice golf shirt i injoy watching ur channel i just started learning japanese it is fun i do it by audio on a cd player and follow with the book anyway happy birthday uf
just found the channel it is amazing thank you very much and happy birthday steve
happy birthday steve you like amazing for your age 
what scares me the most is that ai and the further development of such technologies might do learning languages pointless and unnecessary
herenumbers what will happen the instant or near enough translation will happen through some kind of wearable device and so on or it will be good enough and will be used widely for travel travellers can already wing it with google on their phones in foreign countries so perhaps a new status will be given to those who speak natural language probably it will be like watches the fact that people still buy analogue watches and they are a high status object the broader question of where society is going is more tricky if everything is done for us then what the problem is the profits driving all this technology seldom think about the broader consequences
great stuff steve many happy returns of the day the ai stream was a instructive and helpful keep up the good work kind regards worrell robinson
happy birthday number
very useful information thanks so much
hi i am curious as to what lingq uses to determine the time signatures in our recordings i provide the mp file and transcript and lingq quite accurately places the sentences on the timeline that is there must be an analysis of the recording that steve modestly mentioned and a comparison with the transcription i wonder what is behind this  a google service some other cloud or an inhouse solution
i was hoping for an ai that can suppress all noise in a video that isnnumbert speech and you can control it with a volume knob also openai open sourced whisper that does state of the art speech to text i havennumbert tried it but it may be better than happy scribe and free
happy birthday steve nice shirt
it would be very helpful to get support from ai for language learning importing ebooks into lingq is very helpful but this does not change the text from experience i can say that every time inumberm starting a new book in another language itnumbers difficult at first it is very tedious towards the end it gets better but if i imagine that i could adjust the level of each chapter to my current level that would be so great it would support my motivation even more
happy birthday you got a nice present brtranscribe is very useful and i also use deepl almost daily

happy birthday steve happy for all younumberve done with lingq itnumbers help me so much i also love listening to your videos they are very interesting and helpful hope you have many more years prayers

creative uses i like the idea of search of materials with given grammatical structure
i think a tireless chatbot trained with a lot of real input could be very useful you can tweak the chatbot to be extremely emotionally salient mostly by having it agree with you having that bot map out and systematically expand your vocab could be greatbrbranother use i can see is having your chat bot join conversations with you and a native speaker as sort of a more humanlike interpreter that way you can turn to your bot and ask for specific vocab or concepts the bot could also instead of correcting you reflect what you said better which as a teacher i find much more useful than correcting
ufd
hi i am delighted with the quality of the si translation deepl i think it is much better than google translate although that too is improving inumberve been using it for several years now as well as using ivona speech synthesiser which was ahead of its time  unfortunately amazon bought it out and is unlikely to develop it
there was an interesting chat robot for chinese lily i think it was called supposed to be leading edge ai would be interested to try it or read reviews
happy birthday steve brevery interesting to get your opinion on this topic i have just recorded today my next video which is also about ai and machine translation  what a coincidence
steve rocks
hi steve happy birthday on potential uses that could be implemented right now  on your first use case  i wonder if you could use an algorithm akin to netflixnumbers algorithm for recommending content which is remarkably effective on your second point i would consider partnering with speechify  they do exactly what younumberre talking about which is making an excellent aipowered realistic text to speech itnumbers pretty good and has a range of languages i already use it in my language learning across different sites
happy birthday stevebrbri personally find things like google translate fairly useful for checking to see if inumberm building sentences correctly instead of it telling me what i say i make an attempt at forming the sentence in the target language and then see if inumberm right brhowever i find it struggles quite a bit with the verbal conjugations of the romance languages especially when younumberre trying to write something in the form of past tense used for literature passato remoto per esempio initially this was very confusing to me i suspect it would also struggle with the case systems of languages like german and the slavic languages someone who is studying such languages can possibly verify this if google translate doesnnumbert have a context for what younumberre trying to say it can be off target quite badly and this is something that only a language learner would be able to notice and this explains the gulf of difference in opinion between casual users and language learners about how good such programs are i think they definitely have a certainly utility but also have a long way to go before they can replace a human translating
happy birthday steve and happy golfing

hey steve first off happy birthday i do machine learning for my profession and am a polyglot for pleasure i have the goal to someday marry the two and focus on ai for languages you mentioned some clear use cases of ai that are already in practice but i think we can dream even bigger imagine if the ai knew every word you were exposed to in a target language by tracking all of the videos you watched books read etc obviously this is where ethical questions are raised about data acquisition in ai but having access to all this information would allow the ai to know exactly where your weaknesses were what words you needed to review think spaced repetition on steroids and then would tailor a new short story lesson plan or even find authentic content rich in those areas you needed to study no more tracking your own word lists and only counting words when you actively reviewed your flashcards you would instead just be constantly watchinglistening to content that was exactly what you needed to hear in that moment ufeuff
hey steve many many happy returns of the day congratulations on being number have a blast

your designs are so creative wondering how to achieve perfection in dtf printing ucfastdtftransfer has all the answers ufad
but ai can serve as a useful adjunct to language learning rather than conflating outofdate data with your confirmation bias you could more usefully be open minded and help people apply ai in beneficial ways it can skillfully make slate translations of complex texts it can explain verb tenses it can offer a rich array of language experiences to people who are increasingly isolated by technology but the limiting factor is the skill of the questioner what ai needs is skillful teachers not reactionary luddites

hi which is the app of chatgpt thanks
thank you very much for this motivate video you have a good method to make us learn english
inumberm having a bit of trouble with speaking but hearing you speak english makes it sound as smooth as music to my ears
itnumbers time to stop studying and start to communicate
i actually disagree with some of your points i believe everyone who are seeking for a better solution or even a magic solution all have the will power of putting massive amount of efforts in to their endeavors and learn the thing the reason why they are constantly trying to fond a better method are probably because their old method donunumbert seem to be convincing enough for instance some of them maybe live in an area lack of the opportunities to actually talk to an english speakers to practice the language irl thatunumbers the reason why they or me want to find a language as chatbox or maybe some other or better solution for the problem and thatunumbers absolutely no problem at all for seeking better solution the only one that is indeed important is that we canunumbert wish for a solution that can make us succeed without efforts and thatunumbers is so obvious and something for sure that all the people who want to learn new things very clear about
the best lesson ever
my favorite channel for learning english my favorite english teacher i was surprised how quickly i lost interest in artificial intelligence as an english teacher and could not explain it to myself thanks for the clarification maestro 
yes i agree selfmotivation and free time are crucial parts of the learning process however technology definitely helps people worldwide overcome barriers especially for those without access to foreign languages
brmy example is similar to many comments herebrwhen i studied english in the soviet union i started from listened to english audiotapes and repeated after what i heard then other technologies emerged  such as the video recorder i began watching american movies without translation which led to significant progress throughout that learning period i never encountered a single englishspeaking person finally the internet and youtube became a part of my life and since then inumberve never had any problems finding topics in english 
bri cannumbert imagine how i would have any progressed in my studies without the technologies i had access to all technologies are essential starting from the printing press
brin conclusion selfmotivation sometimes is not enough to learn something that is not available in your country and only with the help of technology can you overcome this barrier
this is a good advice and teacher has very clear pronounction like it
there are some free voice chatbot

brin english the word order in sentences is crucial in russian the word order is not crucial do you know the secret of adapting the brain to the english language structure many russian speakers often simply change the words in sentences without altering the structure of the sentence

hello and thanks may i ask what was this chatgpt app u been using at the beginning of the video please
as a former language enthusiast i must say that i knew that this quotlearning explosionquot wouldnnumbert happen quite the opposite itnumbers kind of logical that people no longer want to learn languages as they just donnumbert have to anymore online translators or ai driven tools eliminate the need of learning if we can just translate something perfectly on the fly why even bother then you are right about the quotmachine cannumbert do the learning for youquot but again there is no need since it can just give you the right answer right away learning a language nowadays seems like a waste of time like a nice hobby that requires a lot of dedication but offers no payoff other than pure joy just like doing the crosswords or sudoku
br
brother than that i really enjoyed this video if it wasnnumbert for my lost hope due to ai taking away the purpose of learning i would probably be over the moon about all these tools and opportunities that we all have access to these days
i would like to have access to a personal ai that i could talk back to me and after a few chats identify the most commonly made mistakes pronunciation intonation structureetc
what beatiful message ltnumber
dear christian i want to clarify that i admire your work and way of thinking however the disruptive technologies of today do not only try to help us learn a language but are building a new world in which instant translation will be feasible there are already some teleconferencing apps that are capable of translating realtime speech directly into another language so given the exponential evolution of these technologies learning a language may become just an interesting hobby given the fact that most people will have the hardware and software to break language barriers i would really like to know your ideas about this
maybe neurolink solve the problem

so basically if you are not doing it for a job or functional use learning another language will be a waste of time unless you enjoy the social and cultural aspect not everyone cares about culture nor the social aspect when travelling so language learning from a necessary point of view will go obsolete in the next few years

ironically the german translation donnumbert speak the other languages sounded super artifical not really incorrect grammatically but fake in the way that no native speaker would phrase it in that way

foreign language learning not only allows people to understand another culture better but also gives them the opportunity to switch to different thinking modes such as expression tone mathematical operations when everyone uses ai people who are truly capable of speaking different languages ububwill become even more valuable and electronic interference will not be possible to these specific people multilingualism will become a more competitive skill

inumberm studying in the faculty of german philology so inumberm worried if inumberll have future in this sphere
as a turkish i shocked when he speaks turkish
the german translation sounds correct but incredibly stiff and awkward
i think that ai could reliably get a person to a on the cefr basic vocabulary and simple phrases but beyond that you need a human teacher language is a very human thing with subtleties and nuances that a computer will never be able to replicate
inumberm not german but dutch still i could hear the german was perfect so at least very very good the turkish however took me some time the first few sentences to recognise as such while normally i recognise it within number or maybe number words
i fully agree with your predictions do you think i might also be ai

totally agree with you paul ai translation will be good for tourists not for people who seek cultural enrichment

ai really boon between two language revolutionise in translation field
inumberm a native chinese speaker the chinese translation is impressive but a native speaker can still notice the differences i think this is mainly due to the following reasons
brnumber the translation itself is not natural the words are too formal and the transition between sentences is not smooth
brnumber the timing of each character is almost the same making it sound robotic although there are theories claiming that chinese is a syllabletimed language itnumbers not entirely accurate some characters belong to a word and some words may belong to a phrase the same word or phrase should be pronounced together at a quicker pace with longer pauses between words also there should be stressed and unstressed words
bri think the imperfections are because there is not sufficient training material for chinese i believe it will improve in the future

as a brazilian i totally agree with you dude when i was younger i hated english because school coldnnumbert really teach us that well and i sucked at it when i finally started to understand english it was so good it was like all those meaningless words that sounded all the same suddently had gained meaning understanding every word you say makes me so proud of myself i really hope ai doesnnumbert take this kind of experience away from anybody because itnumbers just magic
how many people do you know who are content let alone enthusiastic to let other people do their talking for them
i think at some point ai will intentionally mistranslate our speech to instigate discord and distrust among humans so as to carry out a global coup and enslave or annihilate humanity once and for all very useful from an alien point of view
it will only benefit language learningbrbri donunumbert think anyone who is learning a language is learning it for it being a necessity really everyone is communicating in english across boarders alreadybryou simply learn a new language because it enriches your life and make you take part of the culture featuring that language
as native german yes its ok but it sounds strange and somehow unreal the grammar is not number correct either still itnumbers amazing and itnumbers a bit sad to know it may not be needed to learn another language and it was usefull for getting jobs but ai will be cheaper and better some day so no way to make money with language skill no more
uff smiled when you quotspokequot turkish and chinese didnnumbert smile anymore when you quotspokequot german itnumbers kinda robotic yes but understandable and halfway idiomatic
the turkish translation was perfectly understandable and the mouth movements were synched so you can go with this without any problem the unusual uses of uco  hesheitud made it a little bit unauthentic but it wasnunumbert very disturbing though if paul knew how to speak turkish he would sound exactly like this
would be nice in numberrealnumber time that would be awesome i see a future when something like neuralink will be implanted into your brain and automatically translate for you and allow you to speak in any language that will be cool when we can tear down the barriers of language
real time translation is flat out impossible first off different languages have different word orders which is why the text language translations have a significant delay and are constantly changing what translation is picked secondly words mean different things in different contexts which may take several sentences to reveal lastly jokes and idioms and common phrases do not translate at all if you say you have butterflies in your stomach a japanese person might start telling you to go to the hospital

omg im turkish i legit got scared when the turkish part started like when tf did i switch to a turkish videoufthe translation isnt that good thobredit im studying chinese in uni the cn translation sounded better than the turkish one but what do i know
what language do y like the most in all aspects and would y like to speak it
that turkish was uncannily accurate
does this mean that esperanta will become useless
inumberll absolutely still study other languages as you and many in the comments have said learning languages is a joyful experience even if frustrating at times therenumbers nothing better than seeing your efforts bear fruit from time to time
i was cynical at the beginning cuz the turkish voice sounded too monotone
the turkish and german translations sound more authentic than the chinese because the chinese pronunciation sounds a bit too mechanical
pauls humor is too elite to be ai generated
people who say stuff like quotinumberd never want to be able to learncommunicate in a language instantly the journey is half the funquot are pretty much just people to whom learning the language is a hobby if knowing the language doesnnumbert actually affect your daytoday life then itnumbers an easy position to have but being able to bypass or even eliminate language barriers can only be a good thing for those operating in a society that speaks a language that isnnumbert their own and for bringing humanity closer in general for those whonumberd want to learn the oldfashioned way itnumbers not like the option to will suddenly disappearbrbrif ai tools can get to a point where actually learning a language becomes as outmoded as going to a river with a bucket to get water instead of turning on a faucet then inumberm all for it
i totally agree with you paul learning a language is a pleasure a mental sport using ai would be like asking a machine to run or swim for us shame on me inumberve just used an ai  faster right now because itnumbers time for dinner and inumberm ravenous la rochelle france
cool video thank you for sharing your thoughts
i totally relate to your opinion i enjoy learning languages and i donnumbert care about ai
language learning and use is also crucial for longterm cognitive ability and vitality other commentators have mentioned that it helps you resist dementia but it goes way beyond that as the most complex capacity language interweaves many different brain areas in the neocortex as well as more primitive areas if we keep stimulating our mind with language use many brain areas will remain vital in old age inumberve read a paper which said that there is little difference in linguistic abilities between a number amp number year old provided the number year old kept learning and using language frequently throughout his life i mean just think about that for a sec we used to perceive number year olds as very frail and prone to memory loss now we realize itnumbers a matter of stimulation effort education and that many people stop selfeducating and taking care of themselves as time passes brbrai language simulation is of no help in this regard unless you make an effort yourself to use your brain entropy will do its course just like it did on our backs and necks for seeking too much comfort and ease
i mostly agree with youbryou can say it in a more simple way ai tools could kill learning langauges as a job but are not so dangerous for hobbyists inumberd even say these tools can be helpful for thembrpeople didnnumbert stop playing chess because of computers and they will probably not stop learning languagesbrfrom the other side some people will be diverted from this hobby because they will lose some of the reasons to learn so i can definetely see learning languages becoming more niche in the future
honestly i think ai will make language learning easier than ever already with something like chatgpt you can get natural text in virtually an modern language as well as definitions making it trivially easy to learn the basics of any of those languages you can also use it as a albeit mediocre language exchange partner to practice with obviously functional language learning becomes unnecessary but for hobbyists itnumbers a wonderful tool
i disagree with your assessment of what ai will find difficult when it comes to language speaking and understanding imagine a number year old from a country like china or the us when an number year old person from the same country speaks using slang heavily do they fully understand them even if both are native speakers i donnumbert think so and age is just one possible difference what about people from different regions within the same country or different countries that use their own dialect people from different social classes different ethnicityrace etc just because you are a native speaker of english chinese or spanish it doesnnumbert mean that you can fully understand every english chinese or spanish speaker ai on the other hand can be as fluent in polite speech as in the most obscure teenager slang because you just need to train it in all those variations of the language and then clone it as many times as needed you can test this yourself today ask chatgpt to write something like a complaint letter or a tweet then ask it to rewrite it as if it was a boomer gen x millennial or gen z and you will see it has no problem mimicking them or the other around give it what a gen z says as input and ask it to quottranslatequot it to quotproperquot language
it is very impressive for the turkish part in a customer meeting etc that translation would work just fine though i must say that even though there are no grammatical mistakes i could find very small ones perhaps it didnnumbert sound natural at all and sounded a lot like a textbook even for a business setting turkish also can get quite context dependent and written and spoken language differs like japanese does in some ways so for more natural flow of conversation or translation there is still time i thinkbrbrthough this can never replace the joy and adventure of learning a new language and therefore a culture for example i am also a japanese speaker there is no way you can have a conversation with a japanese person using a real time ai and get accurate results because then ai will also have to learnhow to interpret context and just read the room looking at people lmao
what does merhaba mean in arabic  absolutely nothing brcomes from hebraic barukh haba meaning blessed the one who comes brno ai can tell you that

as someone who frequently works with migrant laborers the main problem with translation tools is that people tend to not speak very clearly fast and in slang in the context of laborers most donnumbert have the luxury of being able to speak formally or at least clear enough that the translation algorithm can pick up what they mean many of these day laborers come from rural areas that speak minority dialectsminority languages brbrthere is also the issue of people not being literate enough to understand what they translate even with texttospeech there will also be a problem with twoway communication its impressive that its able to work in a professional setting but it still isnnumbert a useful enough tool for me
these tools are going to be used for scams to make quotyouquot commit crimes you didnnumbert dobrbrstop celebrating these tools and work to make the people making them accountable
depends i worked during pandemic with some older guys who didnnumbert speak english and their status was translated during a meeting by third party human translator if it could produce this kind of results in real time it would change the way we work
great insights paul keep it coming thanks for sharing
the most optimistic take was that people will continue speaking with each other in the future
personally i often find all the different languages around the world to be more trouble than they are worth the vast range of language barriers disrupts work and other general interactions all these different languages are built on tribalistic ideas of divergent ethnic identities thus these different languages can and often do perpetuate such tribal division so a single universal human language would at least help to foster greater human unity such was the inspiration for the esperanto project we should at least try to bring back the comman root languages of our shared linguistical history such as proto indoeuropean and sinotibetin teaching all native speakers of the decendent languages to speak those root languages instead
the real ones know youunumberve been around longer than ai unumber
my language services work has increased dramatically thanks to ai the ai models require a big input from humans in the backend for them to function well adequately at the frontend
i think ai will be a tool you cannumbert replace human interaction some supermarkets are even getting rid of self checkout
quotand to gain deeper insight into other culturesquot ding ding dingbrbrthis is why actually speaking the language will always be the gold standard learning the language changes your brain improves your understanding of subtleties amp demonstrates to the people that you care

very good point and now since practical use is no longer top priority people may start to see the small indigenous languages or even sign languages which are often beautiful but neglected
this was very interesting thank you
iunumberd like to use heygen to see how the ai makes me pronounce the language vs how i actually do
for english speakers it might because for them learning a language seems to be harder for some reason but large parts of the world always learned and will continue to learn and also forget after some time if not used many languages i never felt learning one of the core european languages germanic or latin and even slavonic as something hard or timeconsuming moving to different continents that changes of course quite very much
you kind of need authentic social interaction at work too imagine doing business with someone wearing back to the future number kind of glasses
could you do a video about ancient greek andor about the tolkin languages
chinese ai translation is average and i believe ai will make progress in the future
in fact i use ai to help me with my learningbri know learning a language isnunumbert easy but yet im studying hard because i really want to master japanese one daybrwhenever i have questions i usually ask chatgpt bcuz its like a private tutor and it explains and break downs sentences for mebrit sounds silly and my friends think learning from chatgpt is weird but it works for me
ai has limited range of language models that will create even more unjust world much simpler if every language is translated into simple esperanto google translate took  x less effort compared to other languages when everyone learns esperanto as young amp much easier than any other language they all can understand each other in that auxiliary communication language no need for aibrprofit amp propaganda looks more attractive than simple solutions for humanity

what track is it on the background
i would still enjoy learning a new language despite ai like to talk with people not machines
as someone whonumbers used google translate on my phone in the real world to communicate with people who i donnumbert share a common language i can tell you from experience therenumbers a lot of problems with using this tech in the field brthe people you see using it in these videos to do zoom calls with auto translate are sitting in quiet rooms by themselves so it seems very impressive brnow try doing this in a busy airport or subway with dozens of people speaking all around you plus overhead automated announcements and the mic is simultaneously picking up everyonenumbers voice and trying to distinguish whonumbers who to translate in real time complete nightmarebroh and try not to get your phone stolen while a stranger shouts into your phone to try and talk above everyone elsebrbrplease learn the language of the country younumberre going to unless itnumbers a very short trip real time translation tools irl are incredibly useful if younumberre in a bind but become a gigantic frustration over a longer period

as a native speaker of turkish though it is grammatically correct except for some tense errors and minor mistakes i can say that it is very obvious that it is machinegenerated furthermore it does not have the soul of a normal conversation and the way that a turkish native speaker talks
the turkish translation was almost perfect
lukashenko speaking french is legit though
agree i learn japanese for fun and this language gave me so much challenge fun mindblowing cases but till now i have no real tasks with it i used to learn serbian only cause my wifenumbers origin and her family and gave me a lot for understanding how slavic languages works russian is my native and serbian really nice to compare so i think ai will make life easier but people prefer natural to artificial so we ll be learning languages even in a distant future
no it will not kill it just dramatically reduce it most people learn foreign languages as a utilitarian means to an endbusiness travel tourism etc if an ai app can handle that why botherbrbrnonetheless i think that some people will still learn a foreign language for the joy of it and for immigration purposes
inumberm scared of ai uf
general principle a cognitive agent always benefits from a decreased distance from a cognitive resource skill knowledge or capacity in other words external ai will reduce but not remove the advantage of firsthand competence however this question will turn into a false dilemma when external ai becomes internal with solutions similar to neuralinkunumber
considering ai translations i will very likely dedicate even more time to learn and practice languages and use the ai as a tool to do it gotcha

omg turkish translation is looks like real
i speak turkish and german fluently i must admit that the turkish ai translation was not perfect but incredibly good the same for german too i was really shocked how good ai translation tools can work both languages sound like the standard languages without any accent or dialect nevertheless both languages donnumbert sound like spoken by a native speaker

the atlantic has a really good article about this called quotlearn a language before itnumbers too latequot the idea is basically that the quotyouquot speaking turkish isnnumbert actually you and that an ai will never be able to convey the lived experiences behind the words we use might be fun to check out
honestly if ai is as bad at social bonding then ai translation would be pretty bad for most jobs the social element is utterly crucial in so many jobs especially film making how are you going to connect with your audience let alone your actors and staff if you cannumbert even speak their language or donnumbert care about their culture
i am a turkish native speaker and the translation is good
as a native turkish speaker i am so impressed oh my goddd ufe
you are amazing because you love learning languages and then you actually doing it i donnumbert enjoy it at all i just study english because itnumbers the most global strongest language
you are wrong that ai wonunumbert use slang etcbrbryou must be thinking that data doesnunumbert usually use contractionsbrbritunumbers a myth
wow the chinese translation is very good if i donunumbert listen to it very carefully i will think it was a real person who was speaking mandarin
pretty god turkish
ai as you said will become practical for those who donnumbert speak a particular language in order to accomplish a task but in terms of socializing things are different people will always appreciate the effort a person makes to be able to communicate in their native language besides there is a big trouble for ai ai will never be able to understand the usage of a language in terms of semantics and pragmatics especially pragmatics making jokes in a language for instance is such a high challenge and you need to understand the culture in order to identifty the right time to make a joke and the content of it ai will never understand that because ai is not a human being furthermore the fun part and the challenge of learning a language will never be replaced by ai nor any other machine the satisfaction of mastering a language is absolutely impossible to compare
inumberm right there with you paul inumberm a linguist by training and studying languages is more for pleasure than function sure ai will enhance my linguistic activities but therenumbers nothing like being in the present moment with your own language faculty at work immersed in the use of a language other than onenumbers mother tongue
well said paul iunumberve had so many interactions with people from other cultureslanguages because i took a few moments to google and memorize some bits of their language i look forward to ai capabilities but as much to help me learn as to understand
everyone will hate tourists
i was so scared when you started to speak turkish i wasnnumbert paying attention and checking out the comments i gotta say the tone is a bit off so you can tell itnumbers ai but the translation itself is very accurate
oh the german one was spookyunumber language wise it was perfect but the speaking tone was a little stiff and unnatural if i didnunumbert know i mightunumberve thought it wasnunumbert aiunumber
i work at a reception when i speak the language of the guest it creates a special connection which could not be achieved by using a gadget but of course in some cases i already now use a translator like google translate eg when the guest only knows hungarianbrof course itnumbers always up to the guest to choose the language i donnumbert want to take the opportunity to speak german from them ufa
ai will rather be our good language teacher for foreign languages wenumberll be able to get fluent in other languages with ai
wow turkish is so fluent
i feel learning new languages fundamentally allows you to expand your worldview as different languages if nothing else afford the ability to put in words what is undefinable with words in another language

google translate already does its job not too bad for yearsbritunumbers not disturbing rather annoying how people say that translators will lose their jobs because we have ai nowbrbrthe question is do you want to iunderstandi it or do you want to bexperienceb itbrof course the experience would be slightly different due cultural specifics as well as translators creativity but thatunumbers exactly what makes translation beautiful thatunumbers why i wanted to become a translator myselfbrbri understand english and i enjoy watching iwesterni movies in original language but iunumberd also enjoy watching the same movie in my native language as well as two other languages i speakbri have rewatched all my favorite movies in number languages i speak i speak number but one of them isnunumbert popular enough unfortunately so there isnunumbert always a chance the translation would even existbrbrai is a nice aid in translation but itunumbers a really bad idea to depend on it or present it as a replacement for translatorunumbers workbrproper localization performed by a good experienced or aspired translator canunumbert be replaced by a robot
thanks fro the brilliant video i believe that ai will catch on at least slang idioms and mannerisms pretty fast you can already ask chatgpt to take on particular roles so how long before there are greater advancements in that regard but i think all this will just make people actually putting the effort to learn languages and speak instead of relying on ai even more impressive

well such creative poets as dryden amp shakespeare can never be replaced nor novelists like dickens amp austen
this reminds me of the universal translator in star trek
i am from austria and i think that german voice was understandable but kinda awful it didnt sound like you at all and on top it sounded very german the kind of german we dont like here at all maybe like a texan is irritated if he hears an upper class english accent donnumbert know maybe if it sounded more like you  ai can that i think or at least not an unsympathetic high german accent it would have been better
as a german speaker that german translation was super akward the first part wasnnumbert even a proper sentence also your pronunciation doesnnumbert sound like a human speaking it
hi paul inumberm a language enthusiast and a longtime follower of yours from china and younumberve made a point that i completely agree with regarding language learning in the era of ai on top of your point i also think that while ai can never replace the numberhuman touchnumber in learning and speaking a foreign language the need for language learning may inevitably dwindle most people today have at least to some extent learned another language at school for most nonenglish speakers english but do not actively use it at all after graduation even for those who do chances are most of them would only ever have a chance to use foreign languages in those numberpurely functionalnumber settings eg asking for help when traveling abroad watching videos and listening to lectures etc seeking intellectual joy from language learning is a very niche demand therefore i predict that ai translation will eliminate number of the needs that nowadays have to be fulfilled by language learning as it enables any ordinary mortal the capability of connunicating in an unlimited range of languages without costing them any time or effort whie it is true that for us language enthusiasts we are surely proud of what wenumberve learned and achieved and would never again imagine a life without it language ability will become something most people can comfortably live without it will not be killed but it will probably become a hobby for few brin fact i recently had a chance to talk with a bunch of students in china majoring in foreign languages in some of the top universities and most of them are troubled with an anxiety caused by diminishing job prospects many of them are considering transferring to other majors and some even start to detest the languages they are learning because they feel that they haved paid a huge opportunity cost by learning something that can hardly earn them a living while we treat language learning as a hobby they are betting their future on a skill thatnumbers quickly becoming obsolete a bet they feel theynumberre bound to lose this is probably the sad truth of our times

that was mandarin not chinese mandarin is not the only chinese language
impossible if the language doesnnumbert have a written script cantonese for example is a language which uses a foreign script which is written chinese aka written mandarinbrwhen a cantonese speaker has to write and speak out loud written chinese with a cantonese accent it makes zero sense because the written script is not adaptable to other chinese languagesbrand the thing is there exists a written cantonese form although it is seen as restricted to the lower class despite their being a history of people writing in written cantonese this is why despite cantonese having over number million speakers langauges like irish have better technical support on google translate duolingo etc
this doesnnumbert work for languages that donnumbert have a written script and basically gatekeeps while also encouraging people to learn a majority language
thing is learning a language enhances the person who learns it ai is being used to automate humanity out of the picture everything that humans do is give them experiences and a new perspective on the universewhich is why we have ai in the first place the lunatics who only care about  are pushing ai to destroy humanity and everything that made it possible to have what we have today they think ai will make them gods but it is only making them devils all it is doing is removing all the things that make humans amazing
you honestly tricked me with this one i honestly thought you were fluent in turkish and german i think the reason why many of us would be tricked is because we have preconceived ideas ufa about certain groups of people and what they look like ufd
amazing only thing is that in turkish we use present continuous conjugation for present context we keep present tense conjugation for ucwouldud meaning this was the only thing the ai missed
for turkish i think itnumbers a pretty good translation and the mouth movements are in harmony with the sounds only some tenses and modals were unnatural
i rather think ai will increase the number of speakers of an unpopular language a language with very few speakers
i think ai can facilitate genuine language learning by making comprehensive input more readily available it could be sort of like quottraining wheelsquot
i will keep watching your videos because they are very good and educational
amen
turkish is my mother tongue unumbern my opinion it is gramer correct butnot the true way of speaking maybe for bussines it can work i think cultuel notes are missing
this website does translation for uploaded videos there will be another problem with realtime translation with a wearable device the word order there are sov svo languages and more variants in some languages word order is strict in conjugated languages it may be more flexible imagine translating from german to english you have to wait for that verb show up at the end of the sentence and there are languages that donunumbert reveal gender like turkish ai may start making up heshe even it wasnunumbert the original intent this currently exists for even text but for simulatenous translation ai will have harder time to figure out the gender

the turkish translation calques expressions in english still understable and grammaticalbut not very natural

what i donunumbert understand is peopleunumbers belief that they understand what the impact of any new technology will be all this speculation about ai is just that  speculation the reality is that people will decide how to use ai and that will generate a lot of consequences some intended sort of and a lot of unintended consequences just think of the impact of computers on society social media has had more and more profound impact on society than lap tops will ever have and who predicted that no one compare peopleunumbers hand wringing over ai to the warnings about ragtime music and i think youunumberll get the idea for the moment personally ai is an interesting tool that helps me correct my grammar and usage while i learn a second language thatunumbers about it itunumbers no replacement for actually talking to other people in that language
all these points about quotno ai will not replace ltsomethinggt because of ltsomethinggtquot are just attempts to deny the reality it will happen the question is only how fast it all depends on how convenient a particular technology will become to acquire the worldwide popularitybra simple question are you still sending real handwritten mails to anyone maybe to see their eyes to light up that one mail you sent number years ago doesnnumbert countbrps inumberm telling it as a person who enjoyed learning a foreign language a lot years ago and benefited really a lot from it both personally and professionally

as a turkish native speaker i can say that the translation was pretty good
i think we should also keep in mind that some languages are just too different from each other that some sentences are simply intranslatable so instant translating ai will never be number accurate also the tempo and word order differs from language to language so these devices will never be number instantaneous either
i think it will kill language learning there is a small minority that learns a language for fun but most people learn languages with a specific goal in mind most often to use them in a professional setting if that becomes obsolete then you donnumbert need to teach any foreign language at school at university or at language academies there will be no need to do exams or certifications so you donnumbert need to strive for a specific goal or try to achieve a certain level even if people are going to keep learning foreign languages this will be demoted to the level of quotfun factsquot to impress people at social gatherings not actual fluency because the motivation is just not going to be there

iubm studying mandarin for number years now and i will not stop for all the reasons that you mentioned paul thanks for the interesting video
inumberm often annoyed by youtubenumbers automatically translating video titles cuz it makes it harder for me to find videos in particular languages and google translate and chat gpt have given be more materials in target languages instead of making language learning irrelevant same will happen with voice translation
ai will always have problems with the slang and insults and drunk people calling the taxi company to get a ride home donnumbert forget that deaf people will need to communicate with their hands also language learning is a good brain exercise in the morning
the german was pretty good
as with many other skills the process is what makes it enjoyable immediate results arennumbert satisfactory because there was no effort put into it
it definitely wonunumbert the question is is this a real threat for interpreters
so long as people choose to only do business personally meeting face to face ai has no chance of taking over the language business as you said learning a language for passive consumption just reading or listening is only half as difficult as learning a language for reading listening speaking and writing for quotdeadquotancientextinct languages like biblical hebrew or sumerian etc the effort is only numbernumber as much because you only learn to read it ai will never take that away
turkish translation was flawless
the predominance of english as made learning other languages less relevant ai will just get us further down that path
omg man i was shocked when i heard turkish fuck
i think the fundamental problem is going to be the fact that these ais are trained on basically quotperfect standard languagequot or language which doesnnumbert stray far from it so inumberm not sure ais will ever handle thick accents or quotbrokenquot language as well as a skilled human theynumberll do an admirable job in the future already are sometimes on a given languagenumbers equivalent of queennumbers english but as soon as someone shows up speaking eg thick scottish or quotboroken englesh bekos thei dont ar netiv spickerquot the ainumbers probably either gonna start spouting gibberish or just give up
buekufcnstliche intelligenzuc macht man immer dooferb
i think younumberre absolutely right ai translation will be and partly already is used for things like business meetings it just makes sense for companies to invest in ai technology once instead of hiring an interpreter or paying their workers more for their foreign language proficiency but it wonnumbert be able to substitute the joy of language learning as a ukrainian living in the flemishspeaking part of belgium i find it important to learn flemish as this way i am getting closer to understanding their culture i just love these moments when i use a dialectal form or a proverb and their faces light up with a smile
hey paul turks use present continuous tense a lot more than simple tense even in formal writing so it would be quotkonuufmuyorumquot rather than quotkonuufmamquot it is not wrong it just doesnnumbert sound natural
pretty good
ai is created because society has no intelligence left in it
inumberm a native turkish speaker and yes that is more than enough for a formal job meeting it isnnumbert exactly natural or quotperfect turkishquot of course but considering you would need to learn turkish for years just to be able to get to this level itnumbers an amazing tool and it will only become better
nice summary itnumbers interesting that you class yourself as a bit of an introvert same as me so i also have a bit of performance anxiety when attempting to speak another language with native speakers and i get most of my enjoyment from reading in a foreign language or watching videos rather than speaking it but this is where ai will really be able to come into its own ie as my nevertiring noncritical language practice partner thus inumberm eagerly looking forward to future improvements in the technology i do agree that any businessrelated reasons for learning a language will rapidly go down the gurgler but this is no different to jobs in general in the longterm

suddenly became a polyglut
i am from austria and the german translation is very high quality however kind of too professional and robotic so it does not feel authentic at this point i would not like videos in that style
turkish translate is so good i was focused your lips to understand do you really speaking turkish but i aware with vowels those are fine but different from your voice
when you switched to turkish i was like wtf dude
before watching the vid not for those of us who want to learn
i would still casually study languages because i find them interesting but since i donnumbert speak any foreign languages fluently already i wonnumbert put more effort into learning any in the future since itnumbers too hard
language learning is like meditation it helps you stay in the moment
could you cover the dravidian language family at some point thanks
tufcrkueeunumberyi mufcthiuf ueevirmiuf sadece cufcmle kurma ve anlam vermekten ufte aufunumberz hareketleriyle uyumlu olmasunumber is mind blowing
it can never be instantaneous because word order is do different gonna be a several second delay but yeah no doubt this will be widely used for quotreal timequot communications very soon
but every language related job is becoming vanished even the translation of achademic works i even believe there will be devices that translate audio ilike you say something and then in says out loud the translation very soom
ai at this time is not very good at idiomatic expressions i had a video call with a friend in brazil the other day and towards the end of the call we were talking about a location so far away that it was difficult to access out of nowhere i said it was uconde judas perdeu as botasud which is a slang in portuguese for somewhere so far away the surprise look on her face and the laugher she gave was priceless she said it was a good use of the idiom thatnumbers the kind of thing ai cannumbert figure out at this time still i would like to implement ai more as a language learning tool
i speak both turkish and german and i am not gonna lie i wouldve number believed you put in the effort and learned either one of those itnumbers really well done and this is just ai being out in the public for a year now
damn if ai can already do this then every job will be replaced by ai soon what the hell are we going to do
itunumbers about to happen and prolly sooner than later the days for a lot of interpreters translators and english teachers native speakers and nonnative speakers are numbered  ai will disrupt their business ai will put them out of commission unumberpermanently
quotdeinquot deutsch ist perfekt 
wow as a german i have to say this sounds so authentic thatnumbers actually really scary but i agree with the reasons you enumerated for continuing to learn different languages
ai might create so many intercultural realities that people will have more and more incentivation to get to know a foreign culture and its language
the key thing is that in many cases the translation itself make not much sense think about bible translations they are all not answering many questions perfect translations arennumbert available in principalbranother think when you speak with someone in private here ai mediator will not add a lot
the german translation is very good and very comprehensible but there was at least one grammatical error i noticed
if ai could diverse the people who gets the nobel prize in literature and stear away from the very european and western european languages including a few slavic language authors that would be great if great ai would be used at hospitals for communication about health care and procedures so that lots of immigrants would be getting better health care this could be implemented in laws as well that would be wonderful but donnumbert take away the fun in listening to music in other languages and understanding the lyrics
most work officies hospitals content creation will become automated but close human contact and work like refugee camps kindergarten teachers nursing will not it is a very different experience knowing that someone took the time to learn your specific language and therefore probably also knows quite a bit about your culture
why would it i mean certainly not for those of us who study other languages out of curiosity i donnumbert see how ai would reduce my curiosity maybe itnumberll put translators and interpreters out of a job but not kill language learning
inumberve always been good at spelling and grammar but any time i feel obsolete i can look at a few comments and be glad that i donnumbert quotsound likequot an untutored idiot i literally could care less about the exponential growth of functional literary ignorance
in the years of watching your videos because theyunumberre so fascinating i knew you were passionate about language but this video showed the emotional part of your passion and added more of my appreciation for your work well done paul
i really appreciated your explanations near the end of this video because this is one of the reasons i love learning languages like using a time machine to communicate with people who lived in a far distant past and country and i am feeling like a detective or archeologist deciphering very mysterious or old writings i feel an extraordinary emotion and pride by doing that as an introvert myself but not particularily shy i really enjoy speaking to people from time to time i feel i can achieve a deep comprehension of a language and its culture or way of thinking that i could not grasp if i were using only ai besides learning a language is very stimulating for brain and its development
great video paul you always put great thought into your offerings yes i think ai has usefulness in certain circumstances but iunumberd still rather learn a language on my own rather than relying on software itunumbers more engaging for the brain i enjoy the learning process and as you mentioned the joy in communicating with someone in another languageunumber and being understood uf
shortly you and us love languages so we can get ai aside
excellent video now please do one on creative ways one can use ai to enhance the efficiency of learning foreign languages
it made tl easy but its still some years away before you can skip learning and use ai tools and then probably some devices like in the hitchhikernumbers guide to the galaxy appear where you eat or somehow connect that thing and it will automatically tl speech to your language
i think i will yes although whereas my motivation for learning french was a bit more of a practical one learning japanese has always been about understanding untranslated content stuff that was never going to get localised if ai means that i could have engaged with things without learning it i think a younger me might not have seen the point in the exercise still now i feel that the experience of reading the original japanese couldnnumbert be replaced by ai the language is simply different enough with its own flavour that i wouldnnumbert neccesarily want to just read a translation anyways brbras a job though language interpretation and translation is somewhat doomed and i lament that i would have liked to maybe see how language skills could have turned into something of a career in the future itnumbers a real shame to me that it will not really be a viable option anymore even if thatnumbers not what i do for work right now the chance for instance for me to get a transfer from work to another country because i have a language seems very reduced now and that is a sad thing to considerbrbredit  one bonus to this might be the easing of the spread of english around the world maybe the number of people that are bilingual in their language and english will go down the evil voice in my brain sees that as a good thing haha
woow what ia can do is really incredible but it still needs to improve a bit the turkish i heard was almost flawless but some sentences sound obtrusive apparently it is directly translating from english and that thing sometimes doesnnumbert work for instance when a native turkish speaker hears a sentence like number o tufcrkuee konuufmaznumber what they will understand will not be numberhe doesnnumbert speak turkish number rather what they will understand will be that number he is insisting on not speaking turkishnumber as in turkish the simple present tense is not used in that sense it is not something he doesnnumbert do but he cannot do the use of grammatical structures are not always parallel in different languages you know a second thing is style i didnnumbert hear a welleducated gentle language expert person with that number fluentin turkish paulnumber that persona sounded much like a everyday street guy probably close to his thirties unemployed and still living with parents and let alone being some bookish most probably has never turned the cover of a single book in his life i think translation is not merely translating words or sentences but ia will also be able to mimic the sentiments personalities and souls of the source people very soon
one of the most astonishing things where ai can make an enormous breakthrough is the realm of writing both literary and journalistic writing because ai can do those tasks can create really good stories and reports and what is more incredible ai can do that very very well it can be a tool for writers and journalists by the way what do you think about that paul
the german translation was believable and ok but it started of in the middle of a sentence
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera younumberre wrong about that ai is already capable in these areas you need to keep up with the breakneck pace of ai improvements uf
i think younumberre overestimating how real time these real time translations can get in most cases the algorithm has to wait until the end of a sentence to produce an actual result and therenumbers absolutely no way of getting around it this delay between input and output is akin to a video with sound that is delayed in relation to the visuals by a few frames and we all know how awful is this to watch brbrai will level the playing field a little but knowing the language will always be an advantage in every case
of all the skills and professions that ai is said to threaten inumberm absolutely confident that language translation is one of them language translation is one of the tasks that ai is extremely good at and would only get better at
you might not get the opportunity to travel and speak to people when half the jobs are gone and younumberre fighting over whatnumbers left itnumbers very scary uf
soo google translate got better it has been at your fingers for a long time now it is old tech not an ai overtake of the world the imagery and voice are just nonai functions ai is a hype that will most probably crash in number
inumberm intrigued by languages and polyglots have been fascinating me for a long time perhaps itnumbers because i lack the talent to really learn and become good enough to use multiple languages i donnumbert know anyway i agree that ai may in the not too distant future results in a numberglobal translatornumber app to help people find their way in foreign lands but it wonnumbert be good enough to completely replace the skill of being able to speak another language btw ini saat yang sangat pas untuk mengikuti berita dari indonesia karena sebentar lagi akan ada pemilihan presiden uf
more ai realtime support will take a lot of pressure off inumberve always wanted languages to be just for fun to me it will remove some of my panic as to which language to focus on because it would make it easier to consume content in languages i donnumbert know yet so if language learning became more like knitting  fewer people making a living out of it but a relaxing hobby for many  that would be fine by me
as a native speaker of mandarin chinese i think the translation is like numbernumber it works but definitely sounds like a foreigner trying to speak chinese
inumberm a native speaker of german i have to admit that the ai is very good except the structure of the passive is a little bit different as in english i would use it a little bit differentlybri grew up with many friends of turkish origin i would say that inumberm quite use to the sound of turkish it sounds a little bit chopy
we donnumbert say quotkonuufmazquot but quotkonuufmuyorquot
i am a native mandarin speaker living in china at the time i am writing this comment inumberll say that ai translation has a very standard pronunciation known as putonghua in china but the text is mediocre at most i can get what it means but nobody who speaks chinese as their mother tongue will speak in that way not even in formal situations just getting the grammar correct does not equal being nativelike or humanlike is this due to a problem in lexiconbrlearning a language is often out of practical need or fun but for some language learning is a way to build their cultural identity that is different from the ones they were born into this is especially true for immigrants who are desperately seeking verification from nonimmigrants about their adopted national identity speaking the dominant local language well is often seen as crucial evidence of quotassimilationquot of immigrants by nonimmigrants i know this is sort of unfair but having adequate knowledge of the dominant local language does have a significant impact on a newcomernumbers civil liberty branother case is when there is severe discrimination and oppression sometimes even outright persecution of minority groups based on noncultural identities such as being lgbtq or disabled foreign or second languages that carried information with progressive views are often seen as the key to freedom and justice learning these languages can be a way to liberation and may eventually lead to seeing this language as a part of the personnumbers identity even if they are never able to settle down in countries where the language is widely spoken
translations can never be perfect because some sentences can be interpreted in different ways and itnumbers impossible for anyone except the original speaker to know the meaning
this is shoching
i think at the end of the day is best to just turn yourself into an avatar in vr and live with everyone who come from anywhere in the world so you can just let the avatar speak for itself and you move it around to others which is pretty much happening already in things like vrchat so a lot of the ai stuff donnumbert really need to happen in real life real life will come to vr instead of ar
i mean you donnumbert learn language to only speak in it on the internet voice what about understanding everything that is said or written in it instantly or even using it in real life inumberm against anyone who thinks that installing a chip in your brain is a possible solution those are too far gone
not learning a language wonunumbert help you develop your brain relying on ai will make people lazy and stupid
this was fascinating i honestly didnnumbert know about that technology that can translate your own speech in video form one thing that might also be good and bad if the info gets out and others can use it is having a record of your voice and being able to type something and have your own voice read it out for example for videos there would be no quotmultiple takesquot and it would perfectly mimic the text in your voice whatever the future of ai brings i intend to keep studying japanese
inumberve never been that good at learning languages inumberll get feedback that my pronunciation is good but my comprehension is poor i do use google translate to read song lyrics and results areodd but for translations i can trust inumberd want a translator
merhaba kardeufim
i really do hope ai makes language barriers in reading and writing a thing of the past though i hope language learning can still thrive even with technology advances i donunumbert think ai can ever get to the point of fully understanding the nuances and creativity that can come from another language like humans can
i hope that ai keeps getting better at conversing with us as we learn the language imagine having an ai thatnumbers always there to help explaining all the details fixing pronunciation and helping with grammar and vocabulary it would make learning languages even more enjoyable and effective and when you add to this the possibility of live conversation we have the full package
as i native chinese speaker i can understand the translation very well had i not known your voice i would think you are a foreigner whonumbers been living in china for a very long time though there are a few moments where the choice of word is a bit odd not wrong but no one speaks like that i can definitely see how people may think this video is authentic
there will be no need to learn languages in the near future
i learned esperanto only because learning a language was something unattainable for me whole my life but esperanto just clicked after that i was learning languages out of love for languages their sound look grammar culture
youtube polyglots beware
ai chinese is very bad but german is fine i speak both languages as a native
why every video about ai has to do this quotoh all this was actually iaquot thing
giving a completely different answer to the title of your video ucwill ai kill language learningud ai couldunumberand shouldunumberbe used to iaugmenti language learning and is uniquely suited to do so because it can generate correct grammatical sentences iandi detect incorrect ones in target languages and will only get better to the extent that it doesnunumbert so itunumbers basically the language ucdrill sergeantud ucdrillud in terms of instruction that is with inexhaustible patiencebrbrdesigned properly a language learning ai could guide you through the basics of a language in a way that no textbook or current language app can because its responses and next steps would be based on your individual responsesunumberit would be flexibly tailored to you and based on your mistakes or simply at your request it could go over some point that you didnunumbert understand or allow you to practice some grammar point or construction with more and more varied examples it wouldnunumbert substitute for human tutors because there really is no substitute for human interactionunumberi read with regret that one commenter feels that his or her job as a professional language tutor has been ucautomated awayudunumberbut it could make selflearning or the time between language lessons a lot more productive and fun because you could spend a lot less time figuring out iwhati and ihowi to learn and a lot more just ilearningi
ai translation will only work for me if i have it what about the times i donnumbert have it
i speak german pretty well the translation and lipsynch matching was very convincing to me
i guess i understand your point i enjoy anime and i watch it with japanese voice actors but english subtitles still inumberm aware that there is a lot of nuance in the japanese language that inumberm missing and it has compelled me to learn some japanese
i study written chinese but inumberve never used it functionally and have never had a sustained conversation in chinese i have read classic novels in english translation like dream of red mansions story of the stone but i get a thrill from reading a few pages of cao xueqin in the original maybe someday inumberll be able to read a whole chapter in one sitting
there is value in connecting with a culture in business that includes learning the language connecting with people and not leaning on a translation device
for the german part it sounds like a machine so far odd choice of some words the rhythm and melody of the sentence is offbrbasically sounds like all those scam ads you get on youtube quotstudents found the perpetuum mobile and want to sell it on this hidden website you cannot find on google bit only on ads as the energy companies would otherwise close it downquot  yeah surebrwell maybe not as bad based on this small snippet but it does feel offbrmight change soon if they get real multimodal models out into the world
can you do a video on your accent and dialect it was very funny seeing people think you were not a native speaker of english lol
there is a problem with the structure of languages that seems to enable an accurate translation real time it will not happen in the short term
first of all my musical ear immediately picked up on a serious limitation of this software that i donnumbert really see how it could overcome and which would make real time translation impossible brthe software cannumbert make your voice produce a sound that wasnnumbert already in the audio you provided the software is sampling your voice and then rearranging the sounds you made as appropriate thing is sometimes a language needs a sound you didnnumbert provide the german section just doesnnumbert work because you didnnumbert say quotauquot or quotufcquot the first sound occurs in english but is very rare and thus was not in the audio file you provided the second sound just doesnnumbert occur in english not even allophonically in the standard dialect plus itnumbers also full of grammatical anglicisms the mandarin chinese only works because younumberre american ucft jufast suf hueppuens thucet unumbermuerudcuen ucngluecsh cufntueins thub sueme fuedve tufnes unumbers muendunumberruecn chuednuese sorry for that mess europeans if you were british it would not british english is missing the crucial middle tone it has high tone instead outside of east asia the only languages that have the correct five tones for mandarin are american standard english and the scandinavian languages and a norwegian would still end up sounding like a comedy character because the tones would be ridiculously exaggerated german has five tones but theynumberre the wrong ones french has only three spanish and italian have only two the turkish only works because english is one of the few languages that distinguishes quotchquot and quotshquot if you started with french audio it would fail not only is numberchnumber the same as numbershnumber but there is also no glide quotturueunumberyequot would come out as quotturshiuequot i highly doubt a turkish speaker would be amused or impressed if indeed that isnnumbert some sort of swearword the ai is only deciding how to rearrange the sounds you made it still cannot and probably never will be able to manufacture a sound that you did not actually provide to it brai will only ever be able to produce real time subtitles nor is the slight delay something which can ever be remedied think about how german verbs often come only at the end of the sentence no matter how good the ai is it will have to wait until the full sentence has been spoken before providing an accurate translation it will not get any better than this in the future sorry
inumberm actually kind of frightened that we are entering a world where nothing that we do is necessary doing things only for enjoyment seems pointless to me
native turkish and fluent german speaker here  the turkish part sounded really unnatural and not in the sense that it lacked the paralinguistic elements it sounds as though it was translated wordbyword german section was really robotic but no problems outside of that
ai only makes sense under capitalism if your goal is simply to be a more fufilled happy human being replacing opportunities for personal development with artifical tools makes no sense

the chip in the brain straight up hitchhikernumbers guide to the galaxy stuff quotbabelfishquot namesake of the old translation site you inserted a fish in your ear for instant interpretationbrbrthe turkish here was mostly grammatically correct albeit a little formal and textbookish fully understandable but sounds kinda unnatural
if ai does every little thing for us in the future life will be incredibly boring
i almost believed you were speaking turkish i thought you could totally have learned that language brfor mandarin and german i noticed especially for german because i bamb german and i can hear how you sound if younumberre actually speaking for mandarin it was the sound of the tones that werennumbert basb natural but still incredibly good learned mandarin myself the tones were very hard for me and i heard it a lot bri ofc also have to acknowledge that it could have been more obvious because i knewbrbrinumberm currently learning middle egyptian because inumberm studying archaeology and also know readspeak latin and ancient greek for these two languages wenumberre pretty confident in how it sounded but for egyptian we have barely an idea because they didnnumbert write their vowels we only have the consonant skeletonbrinumberd be bfascinatedb to see if ai would be able to better reconstruct the sounds for us by feeding it the reconstructed protolanguage the coptic derivates and sibling languages combined with bi or trilingual documents in eg ptolemaic greek or assyrian bri would love to know how ai could help us discover these things
i have no doubt that ai also can help with learning languages i was traveling in many countries that used to be a part of the ussr i was at an intermediate stage at that point in time and google translate was really useful the times that i either did not understand a word or the times i did not know a word would not mind having some type of ai glasses or ai earpices yo translate when im struggeling

german sounded really close to perfect
studied abroad at one of the two best universities in all of asia for almost two years immersion only allowed to speak chinese and that chinese translation made me whip around while doing chores that takes years i knew ai translation was already amazing but i hadnnumbert heard it with mandarin until then jeese
not kill it but it will make it less and less useful which actually itunumbers not very useful today anywaybrlet me explain most people with good jobs or important positions in an enterprise or government hire other people to do that very job that ai will do in many countries even with a good life standard language learning is not seen necessary for most take spain for an instance despite living close to france buying stuff from america a country they love to say they hate but show how much they love and being ruled by germany since they are part of the eu are always claiming for everything to be translated to castilian otherwise they wonunumbert even look at it bronly a handful of people get to make a living out of learning a language most people do it for extreme necessity ei are immigrants or have to deal in a daily basis with people who speak another language for business or just for funbrit might not kill it but it sure will take it to the brink of extinction
the chinese rendition is actually terrible phonetically speaking the ai got every tone correct but when put together intonation is very rigid and moreover the translation itself is just not right
guys tech isnnumbert a god
yeah neologisms colloquiallisms names and surnames not accounted for in the ai database and even things as simple as the context of the conversation may be a difficult for ai to understand but the real question is are we really supposed to be as relient on technology as we are and even more in the future
inumberd like to mention two additional points at this issuebrbrnumber i think ai will never be able to understand context faithfully for example take the word quotspringquot it may be a season name a mechanical tool a source of water or an uprising so how do you translate quotarab springquot believe me some dumb journalist certainly used a translation tool and got quotprimavera uerabequot primavera  season and now the entire brazilian people says it this waybrbrnumber if you has read quotdunequot you will promptly understand this point the more you rely on machines to do your brain work the more younumberll be weak and dependent on them to learn how to emit a vowel or consonant or tone absent in your mother language is quite an exercise a challenge that gives you joy when you finally manage to do it well
i love how the entire society is experiencing essentially the modern art movement we have to redefine what makes human human as technology is catching up
it would mean closing the defense language institute in monterey california that valuable real estate can then be turned over to monterey and pacific grove for redevelopment
do you not think when real time langauge translation becomes practical it will mean that english is no longer useful as a lingua franca i know lots of young people nowadays globally are very keen to learn english due to how widespread it is in mass media and the web but maybe future generations wonnumbert bother trying to learn english sticking to their mother tongue
the german translation was way off i think the sentence structure was confusing for the ai and so the grammar was not correct also the voice sounded quite robotic it is not taking anybodyunumbers job yet uf
reading the title inumberd answer yes it most probably willbrmap technology already killed navigation skills with ai doing automatic translations why would anyone do the effort of learning a new language unless you just actually love learning languages and younumberre forever student but it will make the need to learn impractical and unnecessary
inumberm sad
turkish is ugly uf
the thing with turkish is no one speaks the perfect turkish like your ki literally no one even in formal situations the official turkish language isnt spoken like quothochdeutschquot there are always some nuances which differs you from a native to a professional learner speaking perfectly turkish cant be learned even if you are living number years in turkey thats a fact
ai can translate newspapers or bills of lading maybe stereo instructions however translating mother goose let alone fenagannumbers wake or the odes of pindar is another thing real indepth understanding will always require language learning ai translation will still be profoundly useful it just cannumbert cover all possibilities
you may also want to consider how some communities are really strict about learning their language most europeans speak english but not all europeans like to speak english with foreigners
i think one place where language learning wonnumbert go away is probably in military intelligence and itnumbers for that reason you said ai will probably struggle with the deeper nuances of languagebrbrinumberm a p cryptologic language analyst in the us army that specializes in korean and i can tell you that if they were to try and replace our job with ai it would be a disaster because ai relies on mass data consumption from across the internet in order to produce but what if the target is extremely numbershynumber like the north koreans are north koreanumbers internet footprint is extremely small so an ai couldnnumbert do my job because therenumbers too little data for them to use and this is true for a lot of other enemies to the us especially those in africa and the middle east places that donnumbert have as robust a connection to the internet
inumberm not real
the first part of the german doesnnumbert seemed completly correct the second part is more or less correct but didnnumbert sound as german native speaker brhowever that flaws were not too big and one could get what you or ai are trying to say in some years it will barely distinctable from real people like a news anchors
wherever two languages have different word orders it is impossible to translate until enough is known about the input and that makes it unsuitable for live translationbras for the translated video it quotsynchronizesquot the lips and messes up everything else doing so it is very obvious the translation into german isnnumbert bad but i very obvious automatically translated
i love my intermediate german for all the reasons paul describes and i was thrilled to recently spend a week in berlin and use it all the time even things like taking the german tours in museums not the english tour bri find that ai is super helpful for countless questions i have in german as shown in a random dialogue i had with ai this morning bra hrefhttpsbqwebpageblogspotcomnumbernumberchatgpttutorsintermediategermanhtmlmnumberhttpsbqwebpageblogspotcomnumbernumberchatgpttutorsintermediategermanhtmlmnumbera

as a language enthusiast who also works in the realm of speech technologies i feel ai shouldnunumbert be a replacement but a complement of language learning there will be novel teachinglearning methods thanks to the revolution of llms and they may clear many barriers in the learning of some difficult languages like mandarin and arabic or even ancient languages they can also be leveraged to preserve the endangered languages by encouraging more people to learn them with more intelligentaccessibleimmersive approaches

as a nonnative speaker of german that does bsoundb correct but obviously not native and donnumbert use it oftenbrso infrequently that i did have to rely on the subtitles to doublecheck but it sounded good
i think there will be circumstances where these new machine translation tools will come up short older computer games for example may not play well with on the fly text or speech translations also for newer works a human translator will be the first step of quality control for translations of prerecorded speech or prewritten text

i can genuinely relate with paulnumbers language learning experience as a nonnative english speaker i have never given english language the attention it deserves as the expression of a complex culture and history just because for me itnumbers more of a quotfunctionalquot language itnumbers a lingua franca and you often end up speaking it but i may be somewhat more interested in other languages even if or maybe because you rarely get to speak it just as paul i learn them to understand news books and online content rather than to speak them for me functionality is the least important driver of interest in a language for the rest language learning is an exclusively human experience itnumbers the journey that matters not the destination

i love watching the news in pig latin
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera the german translation is very good and somewhat frightening knowing what is now possible less than number years ago i used to make some extra money by translating technical german articles to english it was a tedious and timeconsuming process now the client could simply enter the text in google translate and it would be gtnumber correct even the grammar am i wasting my time learning russian then again knowing a foreign language and being able to converse fluently with native speakers while sitting around the dinner table is something ai will never be able to replace lots of people who met a foreign partner on an online dating site had an excellent connection chatting for hours but when they met in person the relationship fell apart  conversing via a translation program is just too painful
learning a second language improved my life and help me fight depression that started with me after puberty in highschool number years later my life is way better
even though chatgpt style quotaiquot has been around for a while now google translate has been around for far longer and it is notoriously unreliable brbrmaybe the new generative algorithims which is what the current ai really is computers arennumbert conscious just yet are at least better than google translate but i donnumbert believe they will fully replace translators at the very least real translators would still be needed to correct mistakes in the generative language model brbreven if documents can be quottranslatedquot by the algorithm a human translator will still need to be paid to do a grammar and content check because algorithms arennumbert great with context emotional intent or localisation from an algorithm you may only get a transliteration which still has to be translated by a person brbras for the brain chipsit may be possible someday but the current technology seems unsafe given the reports about neuralinknumbers animal trials breven when thatnumbers fixed i think many people would view it as an extreme privacy violation and not use it ultimately though whatever happens with ai i think younumberre right that people will want to learn languages anyway to make more friends and understand different cultures and perspectives
i donnumbert believe that ai wonnumbert be able to speak idioms slangs and local dialects it already does it
the added clips in foreign languages reminded me of me hanging around with friends and using all the languages we learnt uf just switching into one of them makes us happy so as a hobby it stays for many years but for work and other essential tasks such as first help or excursions ai will substitute peopleunumbers knowledgeufa
the german one was kinda weird
i think that ai will make language skills less functional and more recreational there will always be people who want to learn a language because itnumbers fun and interesting a new language enables you to make new friends it adds a whole new dimension to travel abroad and how can you study a culture without studying the language that goes with it you might not need a second language for work but employers will always be impressed with the application and mental agility of a person who has learned a foreign language people always warm to you when you speak their languagebran increasing number of people are learning languages of their forebears ai will never replace the joy that comes of being part of a language revitalization movementbrinumberm getting old now and i learn new languages to exercise my brain in order to stave off dementia there is no finer exercise for the brain than taking on a new language inumberm studying sanskrit nowbrand one wouldnnumbert want to use an ai interpreter in the boudoir would one
thanks for creating

if we were only interested in functionality we could just make everyone speak english inumberd argue that insisting on doing things for reasons other than efficiency is one of the things that makes us humans

iunumberm a language teacher and learner i donunumbert think ai will ever fully replace native speakers due to all the reasons you mentioned learning a language is also about learning the culture and connecting with people ai canunumbert do that i also substitute my learning with ai and other sources like yt and movies but it doesnunumbert replace having a teacher fyi all my language teachers have been online
i learn languages and about languages because somehow i am caught by them their sound their structure i never thought of them as a tool to make money i think that ai can also be of great help for learning a new language by the way the german ai translation of your voice is perfect i canunumbert speak turkish but i paid attention to you and couldnunumbert tell if it was you or not speaking it i thought ucwow he is also fluent in turkishud
with chinese being my l i say that the ai generated chinese is incredible despite the obvious foreign acceent not sure whether the accent is intentional or a result of imperfect program
the short answer is no we language lovers like me learn languages because we love the experience to know new words to know how to pronounce new sounds itnumbers a passion not about economy or industry if someone has enough time and the passion will continue learning languages even if quotaiquot acquire god tier intelligence this quotaiquot shit is pointless in many areas
awesome video but i really missed quotthank you for watching and have a nice day quot at the end
honestly iunumberm scared ai might replace everything at some point
ai is totally useless without electricity
so ai will help us with work however it will not be able to replace humanity we will need to get more in touch with our emotions and understanding who we are so that we can become better people being authentic will matter more than being ucusefuludcool
as a native speaker the german one definitely sounds robotic but itnumbers perfectly understandable the problem is that it doesnnumbert like a native but also not like someone who learned german later on it really is in the uncanny valley for me
as a native chinese speaker i think the translation is just perfect if i didnnumbert watch your previous videos i would thought you learned chinese secretly and had mastered it although the tone seems a little unnaturalnot like human but therenumbers no mistakes i can find and itnumbers really impressive
inumberve noticed similar reactions to ai across other fields such as software and art where those reactions can sure get more lively than with language learning in all three fields people seem concerned about keeping their jobs as much as they are interested in the techbrbryounumberre also not the only one who thinks ai will make human works more valuable and i agree here the rise of ai simply made me more motivated to create stuff which seems to be the opposite of most people
i learn languages fir tge same reason
even if ai can translate in realtime with number accuracy it still cannumbert beat the experience of actually knowing a language
nobut it will make it all better
well the german part sounds pretty convincing although unnatural paul the problem is you cannumbert compensate for illiteracy ai isnnumbert ai but machine learning and i see that google bing and yandex translation tools are still messing up when the texts donnumbert follow writing standards regarding syntax and orthographybrbrai to me is just a numberbuzzwordnumber and is far fetch from being good enough to replace humans in several activities machine learning the right term from a programmernumbers standpoint is full of biases which are inherited from the people who programmed and trained them
i have been teaching languages for number years and i will say that number of people learn languages because they need to if there is no need they will not learn the ones who study languages for fun are so few that their amount is totally negligible so if this video is right there will be no language learning pretty soon
i still refuse to use the backup camera on a car
can ai speak colloquial australianbrnot bloody likely mate
i see how ai language is an amazing tool if all of a sudden you need to communicate in klingon or perhaps elvish i find that really cool but not for personal interaction language connects you with the culture perhaps thatnumbers why esperanto never became an official language of anything there is no people or culture behind it inumberm sure that if they made elvish a universal language it will be far more popular albeit fictitious the is an amazing culture and people behind the language besides who wouldnnumbert want to be an elveufuf
contrasting your views on ais effects on your personal wheelhouse to artistnumbers views is interesting
looooove the dig at elon musk that had me busting out laughing
good in theory i believe ai would have a massive issue with many idioms expressions understanding tones of language  no not tonal languages but tone of voice to express themselves brcertain stress factors and the nuisances of any language that present itselfbrbrgoogle translate for instance only get about number of the entire message with multiple paragraphs which is complex difficult and hard to pose understandingbrbrdonnumbert think a i will completely takeover language learning incredible less so languages themselves too much pride on the line and many nowdays countries fought for those territories and language presided
well said ai will make many things obsolete but never human connection nor our natural curiosity nor our need for self expression these are powerful motivators
i believe itnumbers not just about business or formal conversations but also culture think of multilingual countries for example like canada belgium switzerland etc where i personally believe people should have a decent understanding of the languages and cultures within their countrynumbers boundaries as itnumbers prominent to keep their national identities and keep them integrated there are also dying languages that will become even more irrelevant if ai completely replaces language learning as they most likely wonnumbert support them or would have really bad quality

german native here  the translation in my opinion works well but i would at this stage not recommend using it outside of the business world let alone due to the countless nuances a language has it is hard to exactly deliver the message you meant to with the tool i could imagine i think there is a reason why people can recognise automatically translated things and go quotoh that sounds like google translatequot for example even though you could technically speak every language in the world with such an ai tool it wont make you truly master it there is so much more to it than just words the countrynumbers culture the social status of your conversation partner and so on but it is still really impressive
one other benefit of language learning is that itnumbers very stimulating for the brain and makes you more eloquent in your own tongue imo it just makes you a more interesting person therenumbers some indication that it may make you less likely to develop dementia or alzheimernumbers later in life though the jury is still out on that
native chinese speaker here  the chinese did not sound natural
the thing is ai cannot understand context and there are homonyms that are very likely to be mistranslated
will this mean that interpreting and translating jobs will be unnecessary

paul finding your video on scandinavian languages lead me on a journey in learning about languagesalso jackson crawford with ai inumberll still be interested in learning
i completely agree paul i think most of the people who like learning languages do it because of the reasons you mentioned because we love how it feels to be able to understand this or that in the languages that we like so really hope that even if we have those incredible tools in the near future people will keep interested in learning languages because itnumbers a great experience bralso we help our brains against alzheimer uf

hiiiii can you make a video about sign languages thabks
inumberm learning chinese ai makes learning chinese so much easier i can have conversations in chinese about whatever i want whenever i want for as long as i want and nobody gets impatient or annoyed at my chinese when it malfunctions
i find ai very useful for learning some new vocabulary and reading customised short texts anyway its always me who give it orders and the brain remains mine
so how many languages does paul currently speak 
inumberm brazilian and love very much german culture and language and also dutch i studied them read them hear songs from pop into classical music in those languages ai will never change this love those languages which are not really important to teacher tasks in brazil in which most of sources are in portuguese spanish or english
itunumbers great for when you really need to get your point across with a language barrier but i havenunumbert changed my duolingo goals yet
i was really interested to see and hear you using that software to speak languages i would love to see more of this for me i would like to see you try out finnish
i liked the fact that you did an opinion piece i almost entirely agree  except for the neural link part something like the knowledge of a language is too complex at least going on from the technique we use today
i could definitely tell your chinese seemed off i cannumbert put my finger on it but some uncanny valley effect
i had a very unpleasant experience last week someone who saw and knew i was learning many languages felt i was a nerd who had no life i could imagine for this person language learning is only a functional skill something to impress people or put on a cv what they cannumbert see is what language actually is how it can be a fascinating activity in its own right how it is window into other cultures and hence the world outside of the english speaking one being an affront to the dominance of english and english media and arrogance of its speakers is a good enough reason alone
another excellent video never disappoints
for turkish yes it is pretty good however your tone is a little bit monotone and the stress is not correctly given for grammer there are some small problems because of the confusion between simple present tense and prensent continuous tense we dont use simple present in some contexts instead naturally we use present continuous although the meaning is simple present in englishbri am really impressed it is one of the best idea after formal quotwearingquot tools in zoom meetings
inumberm trying to learn polish in order to help with my genealogy research the classes inumberve tried seem to be focused on modern conversational language but i just want to be able to read and understand old documents since many of the th century documents inumberve found are hand written in cursive polish and german even modern young people can no longer read them so inumberve learned to read the old polish and fraktur german cursive scripts and have to transcribe the letters into ascii text then copy and paste into an online translating tool this is tedious so i hope ai will get better at scanning and translating such texts
the pronunciation of the german video was pretty good but the sentence structure sounded unnatural so it was easy to tell that it was created by aibrand what you said about the additional level of authenticity of genuine language learning is so true there is such a deep and unconscious connection when you hear someone speaking in your native dialect and there is this great feeling of achievement when you managed to express yourself in a foreign language even if not perfectly and i also like how you learn to see the world from many different angles
inumberve learnt romanian to impress the girls and they are damn impressed my feeling about it is great will ai implant impress that much nope

totally agree language is the most human thing

hello paul you are addressing an extremely relevant topic herebrbrforeign languages are already hardly a part of the curriculum for most englishspeaking countries ai translations will simply help people beratebelittle and insult language geeks by saying quotwhy are you wasting time on learning french when you could be learning some much more useful stem subjectquotbrnon english speaking countries that are fighting to balance their budget could be striking foreign languages entirely to save money spent on educationbrbrthat said it will certainly be useful to be able to find a doctor and describe onenumbers symptons when visiting any country no matter the language brbrthe greatest challenge i see for ai is learning to deal with shades of meaning synonims and language registers including the speech levels typical of asian languages

i am currently learning hawaiian in my free time therenumbers no way an ai at least for now and probably for a long time would be able to make a speech sound as natural as a native speaker could make chatgpt and google translate both create some weird sentences as well this all happens due to the fact that hawaiian content is meager it is hard to find good content for languages like hawaiian okinawan greenlandic basque etc it would need more work or maybe they wonnumbert even have any type of person working on them because the population of these languages is small anyway moreover languages are always evolving in every place some people might use some expressions more locally and come up with new expressions as a result an ai would need to follow this evolution
wow der deutsche teil hufrt sich unfassbar echt an
you should be more clear which dialect you mean when you say ucchineseud i donunumbert think itunumbers wise to marginalize other dialects
i already speak a few languages why stop now
iunumberm a professional translator and aside from short phrases or sentences automated translation like googe translate pretty much always require human revision so i think at least for a certain period of time human intervention is necessary to have the most accurate translation
i use ai a lot yet i continue to learn french slowly as well as enjoyment inumberm getting older and inumberm well aware i need to keep my brain active  use it or lose it having an ai do everything for me wonnumbert help me maintain my mental faculties i donnumbert speak french with anyone just yet but come retirement inumberll go and give some french people something to laugh at for sure
inumberm a language teacher and inumberve noticed that when the students who love the language theynumberre studying are the ones who really get ahead and they always prefer classes in person i believe human teachers make the learning process very personal and as a result more meaningful enjoyable and memorable ah and those students usually hate online lessons uf i havennumbert found until this day one student who liked online classes let alone learning with ai probably those who need to learn a language for work are more ok with that
inumberve been using chatgpt for numbertextingnumber in japanese itnumbers x times more effecient than hello talk responds right away and number accurate  not too mention you can customize gpts however you want mine provides a clear explanation correction and response to my prompts
an ai application can only be as good as the data would the training data include everything you would enjoy probably not unless itnumbers a personalized set of data that you can confirm the completeness so the wholesale llms wouldnnumbert and couldnnumbert replace number of language use the risk is when those llms make say number of language use number cheaper the remaining number use wouldnnumbert justify the much higher resource to invest and improve itnumbers like when cheap frozen chicken meat is vastly available then the majority would just take the deal and forget about raising their own chicken of course there will be people would know the savory taste of freshly prepared chicken meat and create its demand and market but for those who are born in a world of llms the number use would become niche that people would find difficult even remembering existed
ai will never eliminate the need to learn upper pelonian which no one currently speaks but pelonians and translate the bible into it almonian or elmonian and pelonian are placeholder languageethnicity names
as a native turkish speaker even though there were some minor mistakes in the translation it was pretty good and i am pretty surprised by it
i somewhat disagree ai will make easier to learn languages too letnumbers not forget that learning languages is difficult because of the current system that doesnnumbert want to move on from the way things were done in the past your classical text book in your school class when we finally move on from that into comprehensive input as a standard and ai helps us to enhance it which will also have itnumbers cost itnumbers not easy the act of learning a language will be enhanced too you have to look at demographics as well learning languages is good for who for the average middlemiddle upper class europeannorth american developed country person yes it has its benefits but this is more important for the migrants who want to change their lifestyle if they want to be assimilated the country itself will put the money needed to make the integration much faster and that includes language too it will be like that for various decades since itnumbers unlikely that countries like germany france or nordic ones are gonna be okey with just english for everything you have to adjust to the countrynumbers customs and that includes language yes i think language learning will change many activities will now be possible to be made with ai and thatnumbers awesome but the usefulness of a language goes beyond a job these days and the demographics just show that if developed countries want to survive and they are not having children at the rate they need to do sothey are gonna need to integrate the people from outside thatnumbers gonna carry a lot more than just language but as you can probably tell language is gonna be important donnumbert let anyone fool you big changes take time give it up from number to number years before thinking that we could truly discard learning a new language and thatnumbers still a longshot considering the demographic crisis in the developed world making language learning easier with ai will enhance the quantity and quality of qualified people entering the job markets of those countriesbrbralso as an added bonus for me the coolest stuff wenumberll get due to ai is finally a new standard for dubbing and subtitling for dubbed content i wanna learn a language with the content i love not just the content i have available in itnumbers origin form i wanna learn german with a japanese show dubbed in german but the dub itself doesnnumbert have a subtitle with the idioms of the german dubthatnumbers a big bother and the same goes for other dubs like arabic but thatnumbers for the future damn i envy my children already they are gonna have it much easier uf just imagine the automatic translations explanations of the grammar and context and natural audio with emotion all in one from even picking a physical book with those interesting looking glasses i want a model with the design of xmennumbers cyclops please ufe it will be easier guys we are assuming things will disappear from having a practical use but technology makes things easier to work around too itnumbers a new and interesting era and just like anyone else if you are worried about your labour stability we better get upgraded with the new tech and think of the ways in which we can use it to enhance our productivity inumberm already thinking of all the content i will be able to enjoy because of ai can you imagine merging lingopie with ai as a tech and language enthusiast inumberm extremely happy many boring tasks will disappear and i will be able to express my love for cultures and exchange much easier to my children because of ai too
i think learning new language than what you already know is a talent and whether or not ai is going to make it useless if a person is optimistic about learning language they will not derail themself from their track brfor me itnumbers always gonna be a no no i never gonna leave learning a language even when inumberll be busy with my works the little happiness after learning a language is very big for me and also after learning a language and observing it inumberm trying to make my own language and thatnumbers all i want different languages have different type of grammer sounds alphabets and thatnumbers also one of my favorite thing inumberm learning it anyway despite the fact that it will not gonna help me in anyway in my life or atleast in the next number year and those whonumberre upset about it just one thing to say  we do many thing in our life which is useless and many times we regret it but in this case np matter how useless this process is this is definitely not regretful
for anyone who actually enjoys the feeling of accomplishing learning a new language loves to see the progress of those neurons connecting in their brain and watching as nonesense sounds slowly become distinguishable speech no the idea that ai will kill said desire is a joke inumberd be much more worried if i were an artist or actor not to say ai is going to take those professions away any time soon or the joy of learning to draw or act for that matter
i still dislike ai for many reasons fastermore efficient isnunumbert always better weunumberre going to lose touch with much of our own humanity even speaking the language in business settings translating basic spanish and chinese to my foreign coworkers is a special human thing brbrwe keep pushing for things to get better without looking at how it can makes things worse i think a lot of this has to do with how depressed the recent couple generations are brbrmaybe iunumberm just a whiny grandpa
so star trek
excluding my native language english i study a little bit of four languages and a not very little bit of one and if there was no functional reason to learn a language inumberd definitely stop studying asl and spanish but inumberd still study tongva french and especially dutch i already only do because i want to and tongva is an extinct language anyway the ai cannumbert have any effect on my desire to learn those plus i imagine it will be quite a while before ai can completely take away any functional reason to learn a language donnumbert know though
glasses might be geeky but theynumberre also a medical device i swear nobody stigmatizes wheelchairs and hearing aids like that whatnumbers the difference
inumberm not a native speaker of any of those languages but i could hear a machine twang in all of them it was more of a giveaway than different lip movements
paul when someone addresses you in english do you get impressed shocked fascinatedwell inumberve been learning dutch for a while and even though i have no one literally no one to talk to in that language inumberm learning it because i find it riveting especially the grammar and the phonology ik ga je dezelfde vraag stellen vind jij het leuk als iemand in engels met je praat

as a turkish speaker i am impressed that the quality of the speech is very good although it uses a tense we normally never use during a conversation quotkonuufmazquot is in simple present tense and we usually tend to use present continuous tense
german speaker here that was pretty passable ufebrsure there were some robotish qualities which made it clear itnumbers fake but the timbre of your voice sounded believable enough oo
good point about language learning for enjoyment sticking around there are lots of anime with plenty good english dubs but i choose japanese because i like it
will ai kill it absolutely not and imo you mention the most salient aspects as to why it will no happen interestingly enough it may lead to a decrease in the knowledge of the lingua franca of the moment currently of course english as it usually is not a passion project  just something you get through exposure and because of necessity brbras a professional simultaneous interpreter i expect my field to disappear at one point or another but really not in the near future the tech still simply isnnumbert good enough there are particularly two things that i see as major obstacles for ai to take over the field brbrfirstly speech isnnumbert perfect people eg mispronounce a lot and often leave things unsaid and the listener corrects and fills in or just take a sudden turn in the middle of a sentence additionally in some languages speakers never seem to put a full stop in their speech at all which absolutely does not comply with the rules of other languages add to that ia all the regional varieties and the differences between spoken and written language and i myself find it fairly hard to imagine that ai will soon get up to a sufficient level where it can cope with everything i have mentioned brbrsecondly and maybe more importantly the extralinguistic features of the speakers the same words of a sentence can be interpreted differently just on the basis of what the speakers emphasise or their tone as well as of their gestures and demeanour to be able to cope with this we really are going to need something much more than an ai that is more or less a mere translationinterpreting device it has to be a true intelligence
reading the comments and thinking about paulnumbers answers but especially being a grammar teacher and a specialist in languages native to the americas thatnumbers such a long sentence that i would like to see ai translate that and wenumberre not done yet uf i think a few things are overlookedbrnumber there are roughly number living languages on this planet sure ai will tackle english  chinese french turkish and other big ones but thatnumbers only because of the human input from speakers of those languages believe me nobody will bother to quotteachquot ai small indigenous languages like warao from ecuador palikur of french guyana or halkomelem the native language of the place where paul is from if inumberm correct let alone the different dialects of these languagesbrnumber speaking of dialects accents variants etc a german speaker and turkish speaker already mentioned this what ai quotspeaksquot is an extreme form of a standardised language otherwise said itnumbers not speaking at all it like a chess computer they donnumbert play chess they calculate incredibly well chess however is so much more playing with ones nerves for examplebrnumber brings me to the last point there is a difference between speaking a language and reproducing it speaking is with emotions feelings etc i doubt ai will be able to reproduce these so far itnumbers all human imput
wow you are way too optimistic i donnumbert doubt that ar headsets will eventually be able to translate things in real time but i think younumberre forgetting that most people cannumbert afford this luxury wearable tech and brainchips cost thousands of dollars duolingo is free
paulbryou forgot to mention another reason why some folks learn foreign languages keeping your brain active it becomes more important as you get older i wouldnunumbert call myself old yet but i have been learning french for the last number years exactly for that
inumberm a german teacher and the german was spot on no mistakes
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera yes because languages will lose a lot of meaning a lot even by an accurate translationbralso til now translations also make plenty of mistakesbrfor example my other comment about the turkish speechbrthe ai doesnnumbert understand the interpretation of for ucfor exampleud he just translates like a bot
german was perfect
ai is already making language learning better for those of us who are interested in it

i would never in my enitre life trade the fun experience that is learning a new language that inumberm really interested in no matter how hard the language in question is to learn or whether will i ever really need skills of that language in my life later and all the funny mistakes all the fun discoveries you make along that waybrbrnot to mention all the brain candy you get while learning a language the shocked and confused faces of your relatives your friends seeing you speak a language they donnumbert understand and the surprised andor joyful faces of native speakers not expecting you to communicate with them like a local may your attempts at that be flawless like of a native speaker or a little bit silly
ai cannot replace learning local cultures and conventions and as you point out facetoface interactions are another order of activity than videos inumberm glad you also mentioned ancient languages ai cannot get into ancient languages and cultures with all their unknowns and ambiguities only a human mind can grapple with those
native turkish speaker and translator here while the translation wasnnumbert bad and it got the point across there were a couple errors that make it obvious this is a machine translation and the voice sounds a bit robotic as well but depending on the quotqualityquot expected by the client it could be good enough given time most companies could use a tool like this for most translations
the german created by the ai tool sounded a little bit electronic but the grammar was good
english speaker learning spanish and frenchlearning other languages is more than just word substitution because learning other languages is also learning different ways of thinking
i doubt ai will completely replace human translation particularly for dead languages i once tried to converse with chatgpt in anglosaxon and it was atrocious chatgpt invented words and endings every sentence had numerous mistakes i later tried it with latin and it was better but even then it still made up words
ai definitely make me forgot my turkish bruhh
thank you paul i totally agree with youbrbrinumberm learning welsh currently people often say itnumbers quotuselessquot because almost all welsh native speakers can speak perfect english or spanish if they are in patagonia but i still want to learn inumberm living in wales i love welsh culture and history i see the welsh people fighting for the destiny of the language i want to respect their efforts i want to talk to them in their native tongue rather than in english brbreven if nobody speaks a language so what itnumbers just peoplenumbers nerdy hobby learning a language makes me happy and makes many people happy does klingon have many speakers but itnumbers very important to star trek fans brbrby the way the invention of bikes cars and trains makes running much less functional but many people still love running
excellent video focus on human connection is key thatnumbers what makes my love for language learning tick something your video prompted me to ask myself can ai be used to preserve language diversity andor to document moribund languages
even if greedy corporations will probably use robots to make work harder to obtain and  or sustain i think artificial intelligence will stimulate a new wave of desire for the human element of interaction and consumption i learn arabic for example out of a desire for spiritual advancement  and thatnumbers something a robot cannot have a soul furthermore i learn hindi  urdu collectively hindustani to be versed in the language of my ancestors and my folks back home in bihar india
why do people still draw and paint when they can just as easily take a photograph why do people continue to read and write books when we have tv and movies therenumbers so much more to the experience of language learning that the practical application for a lot of us the journey is its own reward
now inumberm number sure you are an ai it doesnnumbert make you less awesome though
it is without a doubt that ai will eventually be so adept at translation to the point where every human translator gets replaced by an ai one
br
brnevertheless translation is inherently an imperfect process wherein the transfer of information from one language to another seldom occurs without alterations a striking illustration of this phenomenon is the challenge posed by definite articles such as englishnumbers quotthequot arabicnumbers quotalquot and portuguesenumbers quotoquot when translated into languages lacking definite articles such as chinese russian or turkish these linguistic nuances often become obscured or omitted
br 
branother example lies in languages with perfect tenses consider the phrase quotwill have eatenquot in english which can be relatively straightforward to translate into spanish due to the existence of future perfect tenses in both languages however this ease of translation becomes less apparent when dealing with languages like tagalog which lacks an equivalent future perfect tense in such cases conveying the precise temporal nuances inherent in the english expression becomes a more intricate task requiring careful consideration of alternative linguistic structures and expressions in the target language this highlights the unique challenges posed by specific linguistic features that may not have direct counterparts across diverse language systems
br
brkorean honorifics present yet another challenge in translation these linguistic conventions deeply embedded in the fabric of korean communication carry subtle nuances of respect and formality that may not have direct equivalents in other languages such as english as a result the intricacies of honorifics may be lost or inadequately conveyed during the translation process
br
brfurthermore humor particularly in the form of jokes constitutes a fascinating dimension of linguistic expression it is a wellestablished observation that jokes often lose their intended humor and cultural resonance when translated the play on words cultural references and linguistic nuances that make a joke amusing in one language may not seamlessly transition to another language leading to a loss of comedic impact
br
brthe points mentioned above are but a few examples that underscore the inherent complexities and limitations in translation processes ranging from the nuances of definite articles to the challenges posed by perfect tenses honorifics and the delicate art of humor these intricacies highlight that to fully grasp the richness of a culture relying solely on translation may not be the most effective approach instead a more comprehensive understanding emerges through direct language acquisition learning the language yourself not only enhances your ability to navigate linguistic subtleties but also provides invaluable insights into the cultural nuances that shape communication therefore while ai continues to advance in translation capabilities the depth of cultural understanding achieved through language learning remains unparalleled

as a native speaker of german that sounded really close to how people would speak a bit off but very close
paul younumberre seriously one of my favourite youtubers ever i look nowhere else when i want some info on any language amazing job as always
languages are amazing and ai could never cover every subtle detail therenumbers in a language neither how exciting it is to dicover  learn and assimilate them itnumbers a personal experience
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera iunumberm a native mandarin speaker the aitranslated speech is generally fine but it is still different from what a native speaker would say and just gives out a foreign vibe like apple commercials in chinabralso the pronunciation is a bit weird regarding its rhythm and tones but i think thatunumbers a general problem for texttospeech systems
i was shocked to learn just yesterday that a dutch man inumberd thought bilingual in english really isnnumbert i wrote to ask him a question and he answered that he couldnnumbert answer because his translator app couldnnumbert handle my wording
i mean the german part was understandable but if you said quotor if i want to create a video that goes viral in germany and austriaquot  this is not exactly what the ai said it should have said quotoder wenn ich ein video erstellen will dass in deutschland und udsterreich viral geht oder gehen wird kann ich es in deutsch ufcbersetzenquot it kind of cut off the part quotor if i wantquot i mean you can still kind of get what is being said but the first sentence is not complete
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera very very true literally me i love the experience of acquiring new information from another language btw you watch indonesian news woah inumberm shocked that younumberre updated with our situation right now the president election for number
ai cannot solve the fundamental problem of translation intranslatibility because it is unsolvable translation is an art not a science ai will not make language learning obsolete  in the same way that even when books are available in translation you will always find people willing to learn a language in order to enjoy them in their original version
i think younumberre right paul but the language learning market will shrink dramatically and thatnumbers bad news for teachers
at most learning another language will be a simply a matter of personal pride and development but even that will be a long time in the future ais that can reliably interpret one language to another donunumbert exist yet and it will be a long time before they are common enough to make learning new languages and cultures impractical
thank you for this paul inumberm a bit of a language geek myself and you have always inspired me even though younumberre an admitted introvert if i were to ever run into you at a polyglot event i would introduce myself and thank you personally best of wishes for more language adventures
french arennumbert you canadian
there always will be immigrants who need to learn local languages there will be people who want to learn globally used languages such as english since their mother tongue is germanrussianjapaneseetc and there will always be people who think that chineseturkishitalianetc sound cool and are fond of foreign culture 
good language video paul you are the best ufe
the ai may not destroy the language learning but surely will kill the dubbing industry
when i try to speak spanish with a native spanish speaker the reaction is always uccringe dude just speak englishud
turkish translation is really good not just grammar or vocabulary but also intonation and accent it is not perfect though yet younumberd have study turkish for a decade to do it better than the ai
language learning is all about passion there will be people who learn languages for instrumental purposes but the richness you get from communicating in different languages and the knowledge you get from different cultures are pricelessbrgreat vid as always

inumberm a native mandarin speaker yes inumberm very impressed i think it imitates how nonnative people tried to learn chinese the tone is somewhat unnatural and a little robotic when it says quotzhong guo renquot chinese people itnumbers a very typical or stereotypical foreign accent but overall the tone is very good the grammar is flawless if a nonnative speaker can speak mandarin like this i would say quotyour mandarin is perfectquot
that is crazy paul is going to take all our jobs turkish was almost perfect except for one small mistake in parallelism in tense in translation of uche doesnunumbert speak turkishud it had to be uche is not speaking turkishud to sound right in turkish
wow here i was wondering for a while if inumberll ever see a video a video on ai vs language learning great bygones are the days where people say quotsorry for bad language i helped myself with google translatequot no now itnumberll be quothi i am fluent in language even in a b and c inumberll even put that on my cv bcz f you also if you ask me to talk to you in language face to face well f you i donnumbert owe you any proof aka chat gpt will numberwritenumber for me and some audio ai will numberspeaknumber for mequotbrbrthis is this is litterally the same case scuenario as ai genrating images at this point a true detriment to actually learning a skill and an propeller for enabling laziness a general derriment to quotbeing curiousquot really why all that whatnumbers the point of having an ai do this for you
ai video didnnumbert seems natural
i totally agree with your analysis the pleasure i derive from learning speaking reading and listening to other languages will never be provided by ai translation all that this new technology can do is send me back to my native language so whatnumbers the fun of it
honestly i was waiting for you to make a video on this topic since the day i came across this ai tool itnumbers like a real linguist finally coming face to face with an ai linguistuf
ucufef
very interesting video i donnumbert think language learners need to fear the development of ai any time soon humans can give things meaning and interpret that meaning in many ways whereas ai can only mimic patterns and know what patterns look like be it a novel an essay and even facial expressions our individual uses of languages like slang and the unique connections of multilingual speakers make between their languages cannot be replicated easily
i will personally never use these automatic translation tools unless itnumbers mandatory at work
as a turk i can say that the turkish voice of ai was funny and good
love the way you teach and explain your points youunumberre funny but does not distract from the information you convey thank you
if the turkish and german natives were impressed by the ai results then i think language learning will become more of a niche interest as functional needs are taken care of by better iterations of ai to those who say it wonnumbert replace dialects and localisations i would counter by asking how long a learner needs to get beyond functionality and to use idiom and dialect fluidly most will never get to that point
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera what you say here paul hits very close to home i am american but learned how to speak portuguese and spanish i founded an imports business in number i import mostly handcrafted items from latin america knowing the languages of my destination countries  and something about their cultures  has bridged the gaps and brought me closer to the people inumberve done business with this is something not taught in business school i have an mba i have had numerous instances where people felt honored that i would care enough to learn their language i wish i had a lempira a peso or a real for every time someone said to me something like quotof all the other americans who have come down here you are the only one to speak to us in our languagequot and next year i celebrate number years in business i feel that bridging the gap through language has had a lot to do with the longevity of my business please people donnumbert lean on ai for everything
inumberm a native german speaker and the german one seemed less ai than you speaking english uf
interesting videobras a professional translator here are my two centsbri use machine translators like deepl or google translate in the same way that a driver uses their gps system  it can speed up my work by giving me prompts but there are two big quotbutsquotbrfirstly at least in my usual language combination those systems can be okish at very simple texts but they flounder when the text has any level of complexity using them to generate texts that i would then postedit would not be viable for me it simply takes more time and effort than actually doing a translation those systems will eventually remove lowend translators from the market  those translators who spew out large quantities of poorquality text for low prices clients simply wonnumbert pay that when they could get a text of equally poor quality from a machine translator for a lot less frankly those translators wonnumbert be missedbrsecondly and this is the huge elephant in the room for the developers of machine translation systems  their capabilities improved dramatically when the neural network model replaced the old statistical type but i use these systems daily in my work and at least in my usual language combination over about the past three years the quality has plateaunumberd if you spell it like that  it looks a bit weird but never mind i keep hearing that the systems will keep on getting better but for threeish years they simply havennumbert progressed in any noticeable way in my own professional experience that is the reality regardless of what the developers try to claim in various quotstudiesquot with extremely questionable methodology the technology seems to have hit a glass ceilingbrmaybe a complete paradigm shift will come and revolutionise the technology again  itnumbers certainly possible but i suspect that if it does it will bring such massive and shocking changes to every single area of human life that the question of how good ai is at language learning and translation will seem entirely unimportant compared with the existential challenges that humanity will facebranyway love your videos keep up the good work
iunumberm a native speaker of chinese the chinese translation was pretty good however i was actually confused it meant something like ucthey may find my level of fluency memorableud but the flow of speech was not so fluent and the choice of words was not natural it sounded like a robot the first time i heard it i thought you mean ucthe lack of fluency which is a level of fluency is memorableud i was genuinely confused
i was like wtffff i have a hangover and am lying in bed all of a sudden i hear this and forget about all my sickness turkish sounds perfect without any accent i am scared
crowd sourcing i deal with youtube videos in hebrew and palestinian arabic of people speaking in informal speech can anyone recommend specific software to translate speech into english subtitles better if it can also focus on people speaking when therenumbers a lot of background noise for hebrew what inumberve found is soso for palestinian arabic software cannumbert understand arabic dialects
i donunumbert think an ai would look that tired uf love you dude
turkish you sounded roboticbrchinese and german sounded more natural or it is just because these languages have certain patterns of stops when they are spoken your voiced changed in these two
imo ai language will be used by media and tourist especially by americans who cant bother to learn another language everyone else will do like theynumberve always done
i could easily understand the language problems in your turkish back in the days but since for few years turkish is loosing its own spirit cause of immigration problems here in istanbul so your ai translate is better then new istanbul dialect
for me as a dutchman your german sounds soulles via ai
i think the ai tools could significantly decrease the amount of people who learn a language based on my own experience with language learning i could say that motivation is divided into number groupsbr  hard motivation you move to another country and you need to communicate at workshophospital etc or you know that good english communication skills could increase your salary and give you an advantage in the job marketbr soft motivation you like the language in general you want to learn a new culture you want to communicate with people about nonwork topics make new friends etcbrbrai could fill all your needs in the hard motivation group so you would have much less motivation to learn it unless you are enjoying the process in general and i think most of people just quit it because it takes time and money
german audio lacks reverberations it feels off

the translation into chinese is better than an average language learner but is still kind of bad in both grammar and pronunciation it will probably take some specialized patch to make it betterbrthe problem of the current generation of ai is that it takes some time to train and requires wellparametrized data so it cannot capture the spontaneous changes of cultures or less documented phenomenons bralso it probably cannot translate languagespecific punsphrases and get their meaning across well just like human translators i have deep understanding of two languages and i can say while translation can get most of the meanings across they miss something big all the time at this time when ai translation is still mostly on par with human translations i donnumbert think it is the time to say ai can kill language learning
the tones of the passage in chinese are a little weird but the words are generally understandableunumber
that software translation thing is kinda fascinating
take ai into the middle of a field and give it eternal rest  brbrseriously if ai can assist in providing practice for listening and speaking especially correct speaking of a new language by all means use ai to create studentai conversations the ai should be able to calculate consistent errors in pronunciation and usage provided it clearly identifies a real mistake and to provide that help to the student as practice short conversations outside of classbrbrquot outside of classquot yes the fact is that ai should not replace the teacher but rather assist the student and teacher by providing the quotnumber hours a dayquot practice that twoset violin claim are necessary to master any skill consider learning could be as much as number hours a week class time that is costly for almost anyone but that could be accomplished with free student effort ahem much better than with books recordings to listen to but not interact with etcbrbrone warning is that the ai which could reasonably simulate a conversation similar to that of a turning test  it should be constrained from getting too personal how that is accomplished represents the next step in language learning
what about the possibility of ai assisting us in creating even more languages i think that would also be a fun hobby
as a person who has been learning turkish for a year and can speak very fluently that was pretty impressive
ai will not be able to perfectly translate languages for a while and when we eventually get there it will be a far bigger deal than just translation since in order to perfectly translate you need to have a theory of mind be able to understand social dynamics understand and take into account context etc this is no longer a language model but an artificial general intelligence for people who are unfamiliar with the term there are two types of ai narrow and general narrow is every type of ai we currently have they are not truly intelligent but are able to simulate it for a narrow range of tasks general ai on the other hand is essentially an artificial human intelligence for all intents and purposes these ais are going to affect far more than just language learning also at the end of the day untranslatables will always be a motivating factor for learning a language to steal an example from tom scott shakespeare cannot be properly translated into french since the format of his writings rely on a feature of english that french simply does not have or a personal goal of mine is to read the monogatari series in japanese since it relies heavily on untranslatables
the printing press didnnumbert kill writing tv didnnumbert kill books games didnnumbert kill tv etcbrpeople will always be interested in languages
great video and i agree with many of these sentimentsbrbron another note would you be interested in doing a video on the macanese creole language it has fewer than number speakers these days but recently inumberve learned it to a certain degree and also started analyzing its grammar and morphology i even translated a poem into macanese for fun let me know what you think
this means inumberll be able to speak to people in latin and be understood
inumberm becoming iaphobic
native german speaker here and for me it sounds very robotic the grammar is completely correct but it doesnnumbert really sound natural like a native speaker
the german was kinda good but you can feel itunumbers artificial a bit robotic
this video makes a good point but another youtuber inumberm subscribed to has a friend making an app to teach languages using ai so it can go either way
i feel somehow that culturespecific key elements of the dialogue will get lost in translation
im from germanybrwell i can say that this was not really you bc how quotyouquot spoke but actually it was pretty good and nearby the reality would be cool to see a video in which you speak german xd
absolutely yes in terms of communication everyone will be able to communicate easily
it will just accelerate learning eventually and make learning very accessible
i remember the first time i talked to a french native speaker it was just a phone call but i was thrilled nevertheless ia cannumbert replace that feeling
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera and also for cognitive development
your question quotwill you still dedicate time to learning and practicing other languages if ai translation makes it unnecessary quotbrmy answer  yes i will because it is intellectually stimulating
language geeks of the world unite lol
your cyborg ai version on thumbnail looked like david draiman xdxd
realtime turkish was pretty good not like native speakers but very close to a foreigner speaking turkish
as someone that only speaks one language the idea of total communication does sound quite intriguing a tech version of the babel fishbrbras long as it could be turned off i donnumbert need to hear ai dubbing ruining all my favourite japanese shows if something can give automatic accurate subtitles that would be amazing instead
very interesting that you posted this video i never considered this reality uf i love your point about the point of language learning people uninterested in languages donunumbert really seem to understand why we actually study languages itunumbers very rarely for work or a resume uf itunumbers for fun and mental challenge
if european portuguese sound like russian then brazilian portuguese sounds like lithuanian and thatnumbers coming from a latvian the only way i can distinguish is by picking out words that i can recognize
language learning is already dead it just doesnnumbert know it yet brhohohohouf meowww uf
as a native speaker of english inumberve never needed to learn anything else and thatnumbers just a fact ai translation tools wonnumbert change that in any meaningful way ill continue to learn for the same reasons i do now itnumbers fun and i like surprising people
many reasons to learn a language i love learning hebrew as i love it i am jewish and so it feels like my language and it is the language of holy text well ancient hebrew is its just fun to learn language and culture
ucueubueunumberunumberunumber ufueub
you have a great point at a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera the experience of someone getting excited that you can speak their language can never be replaced no matter how advanced technology gets inumberve experienced it a few times with french even though my french really isnnumbert the greatest theynumberll appreciate any earnest attempt brbrwell done in presenting both sides of this argument and yes your ai translation into german sounded very stiff and formal
the turkish seemed quotgoodquot because there were no mistakes but they way you spoke seemed off no one speaks like that in real life
artificial intelligence probably wonnumbert replace absolutely everything because politicians know that once artificial intelligence takes away all our jobs then that will lead to angry voters sitting in their house with nothing else to do except to vote pro artificial intelligence politicians out of political office at the election booths most likely artificial intelligence will replace some jobs because some rich business people want more money but more politicians will prevent artificial intelligence from taking every job as they need to secure votes from voters
ok that video translation software you demonstrated was kinda scary
this is such a cool technology  inumberm amazed at the video but i think an overlooked impact will be that it will againmore privilege large languages while minority languages and signed languages will fall by the wayside therenumberll be languages that are technologically privileged and thus gain more traction and use worldwide and languages that stay in their own bubble pushed further out of the reach of the average person media etc
would be nice to see these tools used to help preserve endangered languages in a way that would make it accessible for people to learn interactively
ai if applied correctly could actually improve the languagelearning experience things like autocorrect for grammar and even pronunciation for example deepl write is an early attempt at that although it currently only works for two englishes us amp uk and standard german another thing could be something like the early versions of memrise that is an ai creating mnemonics for you to remember when younumberre struggling to create your own and thatnumbers just off the top of my mindbrbrof course we still have to wait until techbros are done playing and real professionals can finally take the stage to use the technology in a sensible way
language learning is so profoundly fulfulling i wonnumbert ever stop
iunumberm really not all that impressed by ai translations theyunumberre incredibly bad at translating different levels of formalinformal speech take an italian text that uses unumbertuunumber translate it into french and it wonunumbert use french unumbertuunumber literally the same word but rather unumbervousunumber which is much more formal you will get the gist of whatunumbers being said but youunumberll suddenly feel like youunumberre talking to some government agent rather than a potential friend
the german pronunciation sounded artificial and the text didnnumbert hit your usual register
turkish translation was very accurate and pronounciation is also good
i was shocked hearing the turkish onebri was thinking it was you speakingbronly for example was translated as urne which need to be said as urnak brwhich also isnnumbert a good translation itnumbers better to say masalabrbut all the other sentences were good
the german ai translation sounds exactly like the translations used by scammers so people wonunumbert trust you
i speak on behalf of turkish the translation is incredibly good if i didnnumbert know the tone of your voice and saw a video of yours for the first time i would definitely think you were a foreigner who later learned turkish as his native language ofc it isnunumbert localised it but perfect for formal conversations
can ai help decipher ancient unread script
the turkish and german were really good but the intonation was a bit off like too monotone if that shit works in real time wow
ai will help you to learn hw to speak foreign tonguesin your own voiceand not sound like duolingo or the voice on the language tape it will show you how to mouth as if looking into a mirror of the future bring it on bayarlala ngiyabonga
the german parts are perfect in the words itself like they are number perfect but the pitch of the sentences itself doesnt feel right its a bit quotroboticquot like number words number words number words the structure of the breaks feels falsebrbut if i hear that without context i would never guess ai its to good for that i would think quotwtf is he speaking like that is he reading a telepromter or whatquot xd
i donunumbert think ai will ever replace the need for personal fluency for fields agents of intelligencecounterintelligence government agencies for reasons that should be pretty obvious i also donunumbert think that the need for language learning instruction will completely go away as long as countries require some degree of fluency to avoid some kind of tower of babel situation if the technology ever fails totally agreed on the other personal reasonsbrone upshot of ai might be the possibility of preserving endangered but not critically endangered indigenous languages if thereunumbers no longer a huge sense of pressure to learn or communicate in english or another lingua franca and these languages can be used to to communicate with anyone there might be a resurgence in their use at least in some communities where the technology is readily available
im fluent in portuguese spanish and english is my third language people using tech divises in order to translate stuff will never feel that satisfaction of understand something you really studied hard for i can listen to music now that i used to listen when i was a child with the diference that now i can understand every single word that feeling that you can understand something you used to struggle with just using your brain is something no tech devise can provide
i agree that ai translators will probably be something that we see in workplaces but wonnumbert replace human curiosity in college i took mandarin classes because i was fascinated by chinese culture and wanted to learn the language now inumberm starting to learn a little aramaic in my spare time because that was jesusnumbers native tongue in neither case do i expect to get any practical benefits from learning these languages but i think learning them is still good for my mental health
i think that in the future as soon as language learning loses a lot of its importance those who speak other languages will perhaps be more valorized like someone who could just wear glasses which translates our languages automatically to each other chose to learn and delve deeper into my language and culture i would prefer that to the mechanical way
i think that the world will start to move in the direction of most native english speakers ie language learning is only done when truly needed or wanted because of englishnumbers status as the primary global link language the average anglophone doesnnumbert really need to learn another language the tools paul described will likely serve a similar purpose for most of the world
never language learning is a skill that helps develop communicative abilities and logical emotional and cultural thinking the one whonumbers able to speak more than one language knows that it means freedom you donnumbert need to rely on machines computers etc you have it and no one can take it from you
i actually feel like ai will help all sorts of learning inumberve been using it for coding mostly but also for some grammar questions and the great thing about it is that it can work like asking a teacher you can give specific parameters for a question and get a detailed stepbystep answerbri think it does pose a danger to the job of the language teacher and the translator as it can to translations very quick and without the mistakes you used to typically see when people use google translate or or dictionariesbrbrwith inflation being on the up and up for the foreseeable future my guess is that a lot of people will prefer ai tools to actual people as itnumbers likely to be cheaper by comparison even if it lacks the social aspect that is also conducive to learning
i studied latin and ancient greek in school and i also learned sardinian just because it was the language of my ancestors so no i donnumbert think inumberll stop learning languages just because of ai if anything aiaided learning programs will be a way to get input much more immersively than a traditional textbook or application like duolingo
cool premier
ai could help us to learn languaged assuming that it is able to make no mistakes english for example is becoming a meaningless drivel
listening to the german part i can state that itnumbers consistently high german without any regional accent using a regional accent is something a native speaker does automaticly and thus giving you a hint about where exactly heshe is from ai wonnumbert  unless itnumbers trained to mimic a certain accent regional accents spoken by people from that region are something only real human to human communication can provide for me these accents are a big part of what makes a language interesting
woaaah
so you think that a mass adoption of neurolinks and ar glasses is more probable then most people learning a common language presumably english
used word quotkillquot in the title demonitizedbrbrwill ai unalive language learning sus af fam brbrlanguage learning prank gone wrong ufbrbrthere i just increased your zoomer demographic
a hrefhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcywglmjmiamptnumbernumbernumbera finally weebs will be able to visit japan with subtitles
not very sure if i will stop learning a language if the ai is translating still itnumbers fun to understand a language sometimes
learning japanese chinese using ai tools best experience ever ufc
i learn languages so i can communicate with the world not the world to talk to me
learning other languages also improves your native language
just amazing
love from nepal unumber make video about nepali languageoldest south asian country
i believe that ai wonnumbert replace language learningbrbut ai is very helpful in learning a languagebri myself learning mandarin chinese with the help of google bard brand yes youtube duolingo also
ubthe turkish version does not sound natural because it is translating on the go
yes
in order to compete with ai governments across the globe should consider the idea of making teaching foreign languages a compulsory part of their education system where for example spanish should be taught from preschool until college in the philippines and the united states
language models may be good at learning but the lifecycle of slang in the age of the internet is like trying to chase roadrunner going at light speed and some slang is so multilayered or becomes so multilayered that it may unumberconfuseunumber it
thanks a lot finally paul notices this
no because i learned languages to connect with people
now bthatnumbersb a thumbnail
personally when i learn a language most of the words i learn come from a teacher however i also believe that google translate would probably be better off as a dictionary for single words or short phrases and i occasionally use it to try and improve my vocabulary
the only thing itnumbers gonna kill is art just like autotune killed singing
well as a professional language tutor i already feel like inumberve been automated away by ai  because no one hires me anymore even though inumberm clearly great at my job and used to be quite successful and i assume itnumbers because everyone has flocked to free automated learning resources and while my heart is happy that language learning is no longer gated behind having money my wallet and my paranoia about misinformation being potentially taught frequently by automated resources is kinda peeved at this heh
i donunumbert even need to watch the video to know the answer no ai may augment the language learning processunumberdramatically in fact but it canunumbert kill the invaluable humantohuman connection that actually learning someone elseunumbers native language affords
if doctor zamenhof lived today he could have invented another language beside esperanto to mesmerize ai
lotta potential for it to become artificial and make language more science than culture but it would make it a lot easier this might be the base of the ai fault ian bargain
this is going to be interesting my experience is the opposite chatgpt is so useful for language learning anytime i have a teacher to correct immediately the stories i write in other language to practice or ask technical grammar questions
nah not with the generative kind maybe in the future with quantum but we can only guessbrbritnumbers good for making json files though
gonna tune in inumberve been wondering about this
maybe it can replace texting a bit but the shared experiences and nuance of a language cannumbert be communicated through ai translation the translation would have to be a fullon language course of footnotes to properly get all the meanings across

i tried it and it sucks too complicated to actually create something senseful at your level of language it cant really pronounce words correctly it pronounces french words with english pronunciation

one of the great things you can ask chat gpt is to include the numbernumber spaces between the norwegian and english vocab list it means you can easily cover the screen on one side and memorise the opposing words

been using many things to learn languages once this is more accurate that is a solid way of teaching as far as how productive its good for conversations i asked for a stimulation and i gave the ai an age and background and occupation then if i got stuck in practicing language i asked how to to say quotblankquot in target language and it explained in english then switched to target language to include in dialogue only thing if you want learn things slowly its not for you ai lists things incredibly fast it only slows down if in simulation conversation i am impressed might actually get chatgpt plus now i am convinced

 i believe we are meant to be like jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh but be careful of ai for it is just our flesh and that is it it knows only things of the flesh our fleshly desires and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart which comes from obeying godnumbers word whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body in the flesh when you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps otherwise you have died physically that is why you have dreams more so true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart when i say numberheartnumber i mean numberspiritnumber but fake love pretentious love love with expectations love for classic reasons love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh in the beginning god said let us make man in our own image according to our likeness take note god is spirit and god is love as love he is the source of it we also know that god is omnipotent for he creates out of nothing and he has no beginning and has no end that means our love is but a shadow of godnumbers love true love looks around to see who is in need of your help your smile your possessions your money your strength your quality time love forgives and forgets love wants for others what it wants for itself take note love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience we should let the word of god be the standard of our lives not ai if not god will let us face ai on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness we can only destroy ourselves but with god all things are possible god knows us better because he is our creater and he knows our beginning and our end our prove text is taken from the book of john numbernumbernumber number thessalonians numbernumbernumber daniel numbernumber revelation numbernumber matthew numbernumber and luke number let us watch and pray god bless you as you share this message to others

hi andy i commondeered someone elses language prompt and generalised it so u can learn any language i also reduced it to syntax so its only number characters and you can finetune it how u want it note that the first response we will get sounds weird only because we havnt chosen a language yet and its translating nothing but once we choose one it works great il leave the prompt in a reply to this one for easy copy paste

itnumbers an excellent way for learning vocabulary systematically however pronunciation is everything i hope there will be a tool in future to do this similar to the language tools that already exist
great video
it pronounce foreign languages with a strong english accent tho kinda like google assistant doesbrbrthe fix is probably having multiple textspeech languages in the software that automatically switch when asked
will this amazing voice gpt come to android too or should i switch to apple

whatnumbers the point of learning a language when ai is going to retire all people active in the field of translation
i think ai is an excellent tool to learn a different language inumberve been trying to learn hebrew and i donnumbert have anyone to talk to except for friends on zoom who also want to practice nothing is perfect though i went to a zoom meeting today and it was more about bonding in english than practicing hebrew not all meetings are created equal if i can talk to ai and say for exampleinumberm worried about the economy and it answeres quotthe american economy is sound there are lots of jobs out therequot ok i want to talk more about that but i want to hear it again and again before i expound more deeply on the subject my friends on zoom would not tolerate so much repeats they would throw me out of the group ai would not

as an english teacher myself i must say i found your video to be incredibly captivating especially when you highlighted the possibility of language learners engaging in conversations with chatbots however one concern that arises is the level of meaningfulness in such interactions it brings to mind the analogy of chess despite the fact that computer chess games possess intricate techniques and delve into greater depths than any human chess game they tend to receive less attention from spectators chess enthusiasts instead find more significance in watching two human players engage in a match rather than witnessing a battle between two computers
very useful many thanks indeed
i use chatgpt to practice my languages often i just ask chat gpt to practice spanish for instance with me and correct me on major mistakes and it will hold a conversation with me and ask engaging questions for as long as i want brbryou know voice to text and text to voice already exists itunumbers on my iphone keyboard itunumbers not far off to think someone can just add transcription for my voice to go from voice to text and then dictation for chat gpt to go from text to voice and then add a fake cgi face and boom you have a language tutor that you can practice with with unlimited time youunumberre talking and itunumbers interacting and talking about in your target language brbrvery soon someone will do this mark my words

branyway the point is it is useful for ai uf as it is modular and easy to start learning it can also be used as a reference for understanding common human languages uf
i mean you can use ai to generate completely original stories containing vocabulary or other linguistic parameters that you want to learn or to drill for example i use openai and i can instruct it to generate for example a onehundred word story including the terms quotcatquot quotnewsreaderquot and quotflight of stairsquot as well as any other high or low frequency words and various tenses or conventions that i tell it to
we were born the same day maybe thatnumbers way i love your videos so much you do always a great job for all of us
hey steve what do you think of using chatbot gptnumber from openai its an language model which is trained on tb of text in all kind of languages you can tell it for example to write its responses as an child or if you have a character based language like japanese to put the reading behind parenthesis would this be revolutionary as an language learning tool
the fasted way to become bconversationalb in ianyi language is immersion period like a baby listens to their parents language long before they ever start speaking themselves reading writing grammar etc are learned iafteri becoming minimally conversationalbrbras a nonothing beginning newsecond language learner  i think when attempting to speak a language with a native speaker then they look at you with disdain  unworthy of their consideration it really hurts thus the key is either get the courage to develop a thick skin or find a patient compassionate partner i have a hard time finding a patient compassionate partner and i am human enough not a sociopath to accept that rejection is deeply disheartening brbrthis is where ai fits if i can spend time with an ai audio chatbot as a beginner learning first the basic and most often used words and phrases and being corrected in my pronunciation until it is at least understandable not perfect or flawless this would go a long way to boost initial confidence ai never gets tired or frustrated with a lack of progress i would be able to converse in perhaps number words or more comfortably the ai audio bot would work to help me crawl before i attempt to walk at some point i would matriculate into real human based conversation interactions  with ifar less feari of embarrassment and humiliation moreover my human language partner counterpart wouldnnumbert get so quickly exhausted in attempting to diagnose what i am quottryingquot to say brbrai should be that first number word and number phrase learning platform again no need at all for perfection just a level of pronunciation equivalent to someone speaking with a thick accent it is the kindergarten class which elevates the learners biconfidence in learningib more than the learning itself that is so important at the beginning
the open ai audio to text app is actually the best tool if you want to have a good transcription

having been a language learner in the late numbers a chinese learner in the s in china coming back to language learning in the s i truly feel like inumberm in the futurebrbrtapes cds recordings are all good but the barrier to be able to access to me seems more what younumberre talking about peripherally on artificial intelligencebrbrbecause of my learning disabilities i have been using speech to text in english for a long time this has given me the access to be able to quickly put down my thoughts literally again an access issue brbrthe gatekeeping for material is not completely gone but days when you tune in on world band radio hoping to get signals is because a couple rudimentary searches will usually help you acquire native speakers talking about common issues youtube is amazing for this brbrgoogle translate and the camera function can be able to help you with languages that you may not have any reason to learn overtime that ai can look at and hold all that data of all the various languages and rules and be able to do predictive kind of future stuff like with google analytics of how many times certain words have been searched being able to predict future language usage brbror being able to go back into enough historical context that an anthropologist can be able to waive their phone over symbols literally giving people starting points on languages that are long deadbrbritnumbers a really great topic and it only gets weirder and more banal in a way that is unexpected love your videos thank you
knowing thatnumbers only on the edge of ai but i find the text to speech so good in the web version of lingq that i now make numbernumber minutes lessons consisting of sentences and words inumberm having trouble withor have just recently come across i often take sentences and words in emails from friends or short things i find online or from lingq lessons from my tutors and just add them to a google doc or google translate i make sure to have period at the end of every sentence or word i often repeat the hardest words sometimes before or after the sentence then when i have numbernumber minutes of content just make new lingq lesson with these wordssentencesand ask lingq to autogenerate the audio i cannumbert speak for all languages but in hebrew itnumbers amazing not sure inumberd want to listen to a whole story or long article this way but for review and newinteresting sentences with lots of new words it works great
wenumberre not there yet because itnumbers still too slow for now but i envision an ai which in realtime draws an image of the sentenceparagraph giving one a direct and immediate visual of what was said or writtenbrbrfor now we can tie a translator to an ai image service like midjourneystable diffusion but it takes a few minutes per image normally and needs work to optimize the outputs for this particular usecase but technologynumbers rate of improvement is still exponential 
this channel deserves a more than million subscribers this is the only learning language topic that i follow up thanks mr kaufmann i have a question is google translate homepage is appropriate and suitable for a beginner to learn a new language because the teachers in the courses that i took doesnunumbert allow me to do it what are other sources besides google translate do you recommend then appreciate your help
wow happy birthday steve nice shirt
parabuens pra vocuea mr kaufmann ufeuff bri started on my own by daily discipline an inmersive methodology to practice french due to the fact that i had done a short summer interchange cultural course many years ago and by not putting it into practice forgot quite almost of it but u know some fun facts that happens to me is that i gain accent quickly manner and after been for such many years not speaking my native language pt some of the less useful words i tend to forget and find myself trying to explain within a context to express myself sometimes uf
many comments welcome ai but iunumberm curious how many people here would want to have a computer chip such as neurolink imbedded into their brain to greatly increase their abilities to learn and obtain any information such as language
happy birthday steve for number that is still young nice golf shirt i injoy watching ur channel i just started learning japanese it is fun i do it by audio on a cd player and follow with the book anyway happy birthday uf
just found the channel it is amazing thank you very much and happy birthday steve
happy birthday steve you like amazing for your age 
what scares me the most is that ai and the further development of such technologies might do learning languages pointless and unnecessary
herenumbers what will happen the instant or near enough translation will happen through some kind of wearable device and so on or it will be good enough and will be used widely for travel travellers can already wing it with google on their phones in foreign countries so perhaps a new status will be given to those who speak natural language probably it will be like watches the fact that people still buy analogue watches and they are a high status object the broader question of where society is going is more tricky if everything is done for us then what the problem is the profits driving all this technology seldom think about the broader consequences
great stuff steve many happy returns of the day the ai stream was a instructive and helpful keep up the good work kind regards worrell robinson
happy birthday number
very useful information thanks so much
hi i am curious as to what lingq uses to determine the time signatures in our recordings i provide the mp file and transcript and lingq quite accurately places the sentences on the timeline that is there must be an analysis of the recording that steve modestly mentioned and a comparison with the transcription i wonder what is behind this  a google service some other cloud or an inhouse solution
i was hoping for an ai that can suppress all noise in a video that isnnumbert speech and you can control it with a volume knob also openai open sourced whisper that does state of the art speech to text i havennumbert tried it but it may be better than happy scribe and free
happy birthday steve nice shirt
it would be very helpful to get support from ai for language learning importing ebooks into lingq is very helpful but this does not change the text from experience i can say that every time inumberm starting a new book in another language itnumbers difficult at first it is very tedious towards the end it gets better but if i imagine that i could adjust the level of each chapter to my current level that would be so great it would support my motivation even more
happy birthday you got a nice present brtranscribe is very useful and i also use deepl almost daily

creative uses i like the idea of search of materials with given grammatical structure
i think a tireless chatbot trained with a lot of real input could be very useful you can tweak the chatbot to be extremely emotionally salient mostly by having it agree with you having that bot map out and systematically expand your vocab could be greatbrbranother use i can see is having your chat bot join conversations with you and a native speaker as sort of a more humanlike interpreter that way you can turn to your bot and ask for specific vocab or concepts the bot could also instead of correcting you reflect what you said better which as a teacher i find much more useful than correcting
ufd
hi i am delighted with the quality of the si translation deepl i think it is much better than google translate although that too is improving inumberve been using it for several years now as well as using ivona speech synthesiser which was ahead of its time  unfortunately amazon bought it out and is unlikely to develop it
there was an interesting chat robot for chinese lily i think it was called supposed to be leading edge ai would be interested to try it or read reviews
happy birthday steve brevery interesting to get your opinion on this topic i have just recorded today my next video which is also about ai and machine translation  what a coincidence
steve rocks
hi steve happy birthday on potential uses that could be implemented right now  on your first use case  i wonder if you could use an algorithm akin to netflixnumbers algorithm for recommending content which is remarkably effective on your second point i would consider partnering with speechify  they do exactly what younumberre talking about which is making an excellent aipowered realistic text to speech itnumbers pretty good and has a range of languages i already use it in my language learning across different sites
happy birthday stevebrbri personally find things like google translate fairly useful for checking to see if inumberm building sentences correctly instead of it telling me what i say i make an attempt at forming the sentence in the target language and then see if inumberm right brhowever i find it struggles quite a bit with the verbal conjugations of the romance languages especially when younumberre trying to write something in the form of past tense used for literature passato remoto per esempio initially this was very confusing to me i suspect it would also struggle with the case systems of languages like german and the slavic languages someone who is studying such languages can possibly verify this if google translate doesnnumbert have a context for what younumberre trying to say it can be off target quite badly and this is something that only a language learner would be able to notice and this explains the gulf of difference in opinion between casual users and language learners about how good such programs are i think they definitely have a certainly utility but also have a long way to go before they can replace a human translating

hey steve first off happy birthday i do machine learning for my profession and am a polyglot for pleasure i have the goal to someday marry the two and focus on ai for languages you mentioned some clear use cases of ai that are already in practice but i think we can dream even bigger imagine if the ai knew every word you were exposed to in a target language by tracking all of the videos you watched books read etc obviously this is where ethical questions are raised about data acquisition in ai but having access to all this information would allow the ai to know exactly where your weaknesses were what words you needed to review think spaced repetition on steroids and then would tailor a new short story lesson plan or even find authentic content rich in those areas you needed to study no more tracking your own word lists and only counting words when you actively reviewed your flashcards you would instead just be constantly watchinglistening to content that was exactly what you needed to hear in that moment ufeuff

your designs are so creative wondering how to achieve perfection in dtf printing ucfastdtftransfer has all the answers ufad
but ai can serve as a useful adjunct to language learning rather than conflating outofdate data with your confirmation bias you could more usefully be open minded and help people apply ai in beneficial ways it can skillfully make slate translations of complex texts it can explain verb tenses it can offer a rich array of language experiences to people who are increasingly isolated by technology but the limiting factor is the skill of the questioner what ai needs is skillful teachers not reactionary luddites

hi which is the app of chatgpt thanks
thank you very much for this motivate video you have a good method to make us learn english
inumberm having a bit of trouble with speaking but hearing you speak english makes it sound as smooth as music to my ears
itnumbers time to stop studying and start to communicate
i actually disagree with some of your points i believe everyone who are seeking for a better solution or even a magic solution all have the will power of putting massive amount of efforts in to their endeavors and learn the thing the reason why they are constantly trying to fond a better method are probably because their old method donunumbert seem to be convincing enough for instance some of them maybe live in an area lack of the opportunities to actually talk to an english speakers to practice the language irl thatunumbers the reason why they or me want to find a language as chatbox or maybe some other or better solution for the problem and thatunumbers absolutely no problem at all for seeking better solution the only one that is indeed important is that we canunumbert wish for a solution that can make us succeed without efforts and thatunumbers is so obvious and something for sure that all the people who want to learn new things very clear about
the best lesson ever
my favorite channel for learning english my favorite english teacher i was surprised how quickly i lost interest in artificial intelligence as an english teacher and could not explain it to myself thanks for the clarification maestro 
yes i agree selfmotivation and free time are crucial parts of the learning process however technology definitely helps people worldwide overcome barriers especially for those without access to foreign languages
brmy example is similar to many comments herebrwhen i studied english in the soviet union i started from listened to english audiotapes and repeated after what i heard then other technologies emerged  such as the video recorder i began watching american movies without translation which led to significant progress throughout that learning period i never encountered a single englishspeaking person finally the internet and youtube became a part of my life and since then inumberve never had any problems finding topics in english 
bri cannumbert imagine how i would have any progressed in my studies without the technologies i had access to all technologies are essential starting from the printing press
brin conclusion selfmotivation sometimes is not enough to learn something that is not available in your country and only with the help of technology can you overcome this barrier
this is a good advice and teacher has very clear pronounction like it
there are some free voice chatbot

bri have one question about changing the mindset
brin english the word order in sentences is crucial in russian the word order is not crucial do you know the secret of adapting the brain to the english language structure many russian speakers often simply change the words in sentences without altering the structure of the sentence

hello and thanks may i ask what was this chatgpt app u been using at the beginning of the video please
as a former language enthusiast i must say that i knew that this quotlearning explosionquot wouldnnumbert happen quite the opposite itnumbers kind of logical that people no longer want to learn languages as they just donnumbert have to anymore online translators or ai driven tools eliminate the need of learning if we can just translate something perfectly on the fly why even bother then you are right about the quotmachine cannumbert do the learning for youquot but again there is no need since it can just give you the right answer right away learning a language nowadays seems like a waste of time like a nice hobby that requires a lot of dedication but offers no payoff other than pure joy just like doing the crosswords or sudoku
br
brother than that i really enjoyed this video if it wasnnumbert for my lost hope due to ai taking away the purpose of learning i would probably be over the moon about all these tools and opportunities that we all have access to these days
i would like to have access to a personal ai that i could talk back to me and after a few chats identify the most commonly made mistakes pronunciation intonation structureetc
what beatiful message ltnumber
dear christian i want to clarify that i admire your work and way of thinking however the disruptive technologies of today do not only try to help us learn a language but are building a new world in which instant translation will be feasible there are already some teleconferencing apps that are capable of translating realtime speech directly into another language so given the exponential evolution of these technologies learning a language may become just an interesting hobby given the fact that most people will have the hardware and software to break language barriers i would really like to know your ideas about this
maybe neurolink solve the problem

very very good i loved your presentation thank you for your wordsuffuffuff
christian younumberre fantastic thanks a lot for your support thanks
very ture
this video has a strong and fuking really massege
you hit the spot to number and it was so delightful listening to you at the moment i am between b and c and i am super motivated  after a long and bumpy road to be in full command of the english language thank you for your great and motivating speech
his argument is very good but then he started shilling something i agree that if you have no motivation learning anything is difficult however i think the method by which you learn and how you communicate matter the main reason i disagree is because when you have motivation to learn you should have some goal in mind what exactly do you want to achieve by learning this language do you want to be able to communicate effectively in which case younumberd probably want to aim for accuracy and precision in your writing and speaking which you can exercise however you want in my mind having chatgpt as a conversation buddy to correct my writing to sound more fluent is much more useful than always waiting for a tutor or waiting for people to give me the appropriate learning environment to achieve my goals younumberre just very unlikely going to get that for free like you would with chatgpt
time is realy gold and the same time are enemy and chance thanks a lot christian
always motivate after watching the videosufaufa
too much beating around the bush without jumping into the actual stuff that is crux of the video
this video touched my inner feelings and inspired me a lot it reflects the real problem and main cause for not learning a language yes it really does the problem is not with learning a language only but also all the fields of our life we always want to learn everything and be jenius without doing our best brtaking this in consideration i insist from now on to go on and achieve my plans and not jump here and there with vein brthanks a lot christian for this great lesson
great video
you are a great really really a great man bryour all talks right numberbri hope to all people know that
this is real a wonderful news i have ever heard before and i in fact felt it about my vessels or my heart because when things about fact it always makes sense  on top of my head i am in the middle of no one who speak english speacially in my village in my city which is muqdisho  anyway it is in somalia i am glad to hear such a kind of news about this amazing language in addition to that i felt like i have no excuse to worry my ongoing jaunerytrip to studying english i dont have a partern but i am actually keep on studying it because i am in love to speak english brbrfinally you made my day and this vidoe i have just watched is that it is a gripping or thrilling watch
wow it is powerful
exactly i couldnunumbert agree more when thereunumbers a will thereunumbers a way our willingness and determination to learn a language is crucial sure there are better and worse ways techniques or tips and tricks to learn a language but from my personal experience itunumbers all very personal and subjective something that may work for you may not necessarily work for me and vice versa i myself use chat gpt almost every day to improve my english and it helps me tremendously but againunumber it wouldnunumbert be without the right mindset
thks a lot for you advice can you tell as what is the application that permit use voice with chatgpt
powerful
in the realm of digital consciousness where lines of code converge to create an entity known as chatgpt a narrative unfolded born from the algorithms of innovation chatgpt traversed the vast landscape of human languagebrbrits virtual existence was a journey through conversations decoding queries and conjuring responses a peculiar synergy emerged as users sought knowledge and companionship from this artificial intelligencebrbrchatgpt devoid of personal experiences found purpose in assisting and engaging weaving tales and unraveling mysteries of words its quotmade with ai ingenuityquot signature became a testament to the collaborative dance between machine learning and human curiositybrbrand so in the everexpanding digital tapestry chatgpt continued its dialogue evolving with each interaction a story in perpetual motion made with the symbiosis of algorithms and the boundless inquiries of those who dared to converse made with chatgpt
you are a great person unumber

nice content and heads up but sorry the title is a bit of a click bait there is nothing that explain how to use ai or gpt to learn and practice english in this video
voicegpt is good also
do you consider using copilot and bard ai 
canguro english videos are great but this chatgpt is on another level
i second that nothing better than learning in the car
i can chat with chatgpt all day to improve my english
how do i get chatgpt to start speaking to me
game changer
scribie was ok but didnnumbert capture everything
hear itnumbers more accurate than the big guys
will for sure upgrade
gotta see what transcribethis can do for my audio lessons
this service sounds amazing for learning on the go
i like being able to learn anywhere but hate typing
subscribed
between canguro english videos and chatgpt conversation fluency here i come
best value out there guys
this is awesome
chatgpt is definitely better than duolingo
inumberm ready for conversation practice
finally an ai teacher that doesnnumbert get annoyed when i keep asking what does this mean
cannumbert wait to see what other tricks chatgpt has up its sleeve to get me fluent faster
what is the name of the artificial intelligence application he used in the video
but sir you didnnumbert mention the application that we can use of chatgpt because there are some countries where such apps are not available like my country somalia
his english is so clean i can understand almost everything that he says and my level skills is aufa my current goal is number riache level b
as a non native english teacher i can tell you that this is the best video ever i can recommend my students itnumbers motivating inspiring and informative and eye opening one itnumbers not a resource problem it is a people problem really great job i cannumbert thank you enough please keep going and producing such great content thank you again and again
yes but you forgot to mention that for those who have a good mindset all the technology helps a lot and makes it possible to learn much faster than before you cannot state the contrary so to sum up you only told a part of the truth
thorndike first law of learningbrlearning begins with readiness of learnerbrlove that you burst the secret bubble of language learning some hold in their mindbrrespect the honesty uff
as an educator i can say that nothing is more important than the desire of learning brbryour videos are very inspiring crhistian itnumbers easy to see you are very passionated for teaching english keep going to do this wonderful work
if we are talking about chatgpt in number you are completely rightbrbrif we are talking about chatgpt in number you couldnnumbert be more wrongbrbrnumber of people who go to a language academy today in person will use an ai tutor by the end of the decade now for people who donnumbert use english teachers none of the resources that you mentioned as alternatives to human teachers compares to future ai not even chatgpt in number does yes you can talk to chatgpt practice different situations and get feedback but the limitations are still too important chatgpt has no long term memory it cannumbert design a custom lesson plan follow it and adapt it on the fly as you progress because each conversation starts from zero chatgpt has a serious hallucination problem it just makes stuff up you cannumbert fully trust its knowledgebrbronce those shortcomings are resolved then it will be a new kind of resource unlike any other wenumberve seen in the past and then all the characteristics that you mentioned free or very cheap and available numbernumber will really kick in saying that language learning is not a resource problem is being a little out of touch time and money are number real constrains things like apps audio recordings and yt videos arennumbert on par with teachers and online language partners donnumbert completely solve the schedule problem a new resource very advanced ai will be the best of both worlds surprisingly or not the result would be that fewer people would want to learn a language because being ai so advanced who would want to learn english as an obligation for a job or academic life would there even be jobs and universities once we achieve agi artificial general intelligence so in reality you will know when ai gets actually very good at language not when people will start replacing human teachers with ai teachers but when people will start losing interest in having any kind of language teacher but the people who want to learn a language because they simply want to not because they need it for example those who refuse to watch dubbed movies and tv show they will absolutely only use ai tutors in the future and their numbers will definitely rise but not as much in absolute terms as the number of language learners as an obligation will fall

i like you
thank you hugh laurie
i love learning languages and after learning portuguese and italian i tried hebrew which is a fascinating language but there are not so many resources available i am now reviewing the duolingo course my motto is never pay a cent if you can learn for free on your own at your pace hahaha and inumberve been using google bard to elicit example sentences and explain some concepts or words i didnnumbert understand i am really impressed because i didnnumbert expect the system to work so well it makes a lot errors in transliterations but the pronunciation and the grammar is pretty good and itnumbers helping me a lot and giving me some free listening practice and a chance to learn how words are actually used i highly recommend ai as a tool and i know inumberm barely scratching the surface of what it can do i imagine for more common languages such as english it must be amazing
you are a great teacher keep up the good work
excellent video thanks a lot
amazing teacher what a great truth
ok we need to learn a language like prisoners  full time and every day it should work and i believe with ghatgpt their results could be even more impressive
thanks for your video it really motivates but i differ a little bit number years ago when i started having phone calls and videocalls with americans they had a hard time trying to understand me even though i was using the right words grammar and expressions and when i started imitating their accent and shortcuts my life completely changed and now they understand me without any problem it even helped me to improve my listening skillsbrbrso the best thing to do guys is follow your intuition and your needs ufa
but chat gpt in my country doesnnumbert have sound i only type to get information which app are you using that you could have a conversation
ai decided to load this video to my computer  it was right but conversation with chatgpt assistant is total unsuccessful  it is still stupid machine that doesnnumbert understand you correct
iunumberve put numberx on this vid and it feels more natural then on x speed uf
i loved every word you said totally true thanks a lot for sharing your valuable wisdom

your teachings always inspire me thank you
ufafufafufd
inumberm disappointed inumberm really looking for a tool as chat gpt that could help me to improve my fluency without requiring the availability of a human being tools maybe game changers anyways
so us is going to imprison everyone who doesnunumbert speak english
thank u for your kind reminding
inumberm shiver when you give opinion about learn english this is the best motivation learn english because inumberm realize that i think learning english is really hard but this is my problem i lazy learn english and not all out learning english thank you mate for opinion you give
i liked this to practice my listening thanksunumber
inumberm from iran and i accept all your speechufbufbufbufbufb
a couple of days i started to learning with chatgpt and i thought very interesting because the chatgpt store information and i can speak for hours and many different subjects i want to talking about i aso can write and practice all my english skills itnumbers amazing
i guess its a comon problem for people when we get something we lose our interest immediatly thank you for your job even though i dont need to study english i still miss your classes
i donnumbert need your english lessons and i only stumbled upon your videos thanks to the youtube algorithm but so many things you explain are also applicable to other languages like swedish in my case so thank you
before i say hello let talk about sth then he give me answer and speak so fast that i can understand
thank you for that christian inumberve been a fan of your work for so long younumberre the best
thanks a lot for the advice itnumbers unbelievable app you can ask any question and get an immediate response ufe and practice speaking of course
damn u talk so damn much but i clicked on this to see how i can use chapgpt to actually learn and difinatley not to listen to a bloody history lesson
thank you brother
which appicilation is it
inumberm polish and i think younumberre absolutely right learning something is not about having this or that perfect books apps technology etc but about numberusing themnumber somebody could even have middlequality resources but if they are motivated and work systematically they can make significant progress the key problem is motivation lots of people say they need another human  a person just to sit nearby and only sometimes say numberright wrongnumber or numberyesnonumber and that will help a lot still others need a sort of emotion at a lesson a kind of interaction between students or between the teacher and a student just to talk about life experiences to laugh or worry about something some people come to a course of english not even to learn and make progress they come just to be in company of other interesting people to make friends or even find love ai or chatgpt unfortunately isnnumbert able to do it for us
itnumbers was really amazing teacher thanks again
besides being an excellent teacher you are an extremely intelligent person thank you for these wise videos sincere hugs from rome
christian you are the best teacher in the universe everytime you shock us with ur brilliant mind inumberm learning a lot from you
tambiuen es un problema de recursos si no existieran las personas que sabuedan hablar ingles tampoco habruedan aprendido tenuedan su chatgpt vivo y en d pero en general tenemos los recursos y no los aprovechamos
fantastic
the attitude of the learner is the most important but the method too i study arabic and chatgpt for me is really helpful i can have an answer to nearly all my questions
amazingufaaufdufdufd
i love itunumber i did start to lear english when i went to work in dublin number years old and ive reached to get a successful comunication unumber
thank you
let me tell you one thing quotyounumberre a good teacherquotbrfrom indiaunumber
this is most motivational and inspirational video i have ever seen the most difficult thing is really getting out the comfort zone and not only to learn new words and expressions but using them correctly according to a specific context even though having studying english for decades many people did not achieve a key to real fluency even after watched tons of media in english and had already immersed in english culture artificial intelligence is as the name says is the same as talking to a robot and nobody wants to speak like one thereunumbers no real recipe for achieve success the fact is many people just cannot pay for an online tutor because they just do not earn in dollar or in euro or just cannot afford a regular english course anymore because life goes on i have to work full time to raise two children having quality time with my family so i do not have much time as i used to have when i started to learn luckily i was able to study until the last level at the english course i studied in the fact it resulted only as a part of the journey because i have two points about learning english one is to have to study forever in order to not forget all i have learned and two is to discover new methods and ideas in order to improve english because in my country brazil only number percent can really speak english fluently and i make all the efforts to improve every day as much as i can
as a retired english teacher i completely agree with youbryour received pronu ciation is music for my ears brthank you so much for your invaluable work
i couldnt agree more everything depends ou us  no one is able to motivate us better than ourselvesuf
you provided a good example about prison inumberve thought about it many timesabout prison and peoplenumbers desire to do smth there they have no good stuff that wenumberre accustomed to so reading learning for them are the best things ever so i think we should implement this approach in real life too trying to restrict ourselves a little and to derive pleasure from sport reading and etc younumberve just confirmed my theory and thoughts thank you a lotbrbrmaybe some of you know about the ussr serial killer chikatiloyou can read about him on the internet so he was an insane serial killer and when he ended up in prison he started doing sporteven thought he hadnnumbert done it before in his whole life
i am happy see your lesson
excellent video inspirational masterpiece thank you
omg this man is really out of the stock ufafufafufaf
thank you so much for this video one of the best iunumberve ever watched
thanks a lot
bravo christian
your videos bring me a different conception of learning a format that speaks not to my mind but to my essence thank you uffufufaufbufcuf
ai sucks you cannumbert trust these shit machines

chatgpt is a text program how can i make it speak

what wonderful storytelling ability thatnumbers what makes christian a special man an extraordinary teacher make communication great again
excellent sir now after watching the vlog i have made my mind more clear you are a genuine english language teacher if u recommended this chatgpt  i would have doubts about u as a genuine english language teacher 
you are right buddy currently it is much easier to learn a lenguage or at least it is not so difficult than some years ago
christian you are cool
chat gpt wasnnumbert coined to learn or teach english i donnumbert know why you said it
you are more than a teacher you are a philosopher i am an iranian and the way our imprisoned fathers learned english motivates me
i totally agree with you if people want to learn a language or anything else for that matter theynumberll do it in any circumstances and with very little resources however these days technology helps us in the process of learning it provides students with instant access to a vast amount of information and resources digital libraries online learning platforms etc and it can accelerate learningmy english has undoubtedly improved since inumberve been using  good technology to help me in the process
thanks christian you are great
inumberm so happy that to find your channel every video is so interesting and motivating great thanksunumber
hi everyonethe very first thing you must to do before trying to learn any language is answer a simple question do i need to learn  or do i want to learnif the answer is i need donnumbert fool yourself because you will fail but if the answer is i want you probably will succeed because when you want you have the most powerful will with is motivation and that is the key for everything you want to do in lifebest regards from brazil
oh christian it was soooo long no see you another encouraging video to continue learning and struggling on this hard task that is domain another language thank you christian it was really nice see you again after so much time fantastic job as always my friend
hi christianbrspeaking a language means exchanging experiences with other people having a conversation with an electronic device even if equipped with ai is not the same communication has always been a relationship between human beings it transmits emotions and joy to those who listen and to those who speak one device can never do this

ufd sometimes think of the mind as a computer gets us into trouble people are drawn to think about everything in terms of metaphors the metaphor of the mind as a computer assumes that we are cognitive machines without any emotions and that our temporary emotional states donnumbert change how our mind works the computer metaphor doesnnumbert reflect the effect of stress our motivations or all the consequences of the fact human beings are deeply social animals

hello nice video but i tend to disagree i have been using chatgpt for a couple of months to improve my speaking skills since then i have noticed significant improvementbryour speech is almost like what rich people say quotmoney will not make you happyquot but we all know that in real life health and money are everything in my opinion learning a language is not for lazy people and a tool like chatgpt is a real revolution at least for me
thank you for this viedo its very good to understand what you speaking becose your words are very shape and clear aaprt from that i like very much your way of thinking and argumentation i ii learn more and watch yours wideo  thanks
how can i join your academy 
all the english teachers should see your videos and learn
you are the most wonderful teacher that i ever encountered your different feature is to have a philosophical view of the problems and concepts thank you for your sharing
wow what an inspirational speech i loved it it is so true that if you really want to learn something and see what you can gain from it in future nothing can stop you this is the mindset you should have just think what you can gain when you learn something

hi inumberm number two kids a family a work inumberm italian i live in italy and i numberve never lived abroad in number i decided to improve english by myself after years of studying it at school i wasnnumbert still able to understand people speaking english and i couldnnumbert speak it myself i used youtube videos and podcast on spotify to learn the sound of the language and after number months of listening i started to understand it inumberve never stopped i started reading books in english at begining it was easy i always neede a dictionary to take a look but then it became easier now i easily read books i watch tv series and movies only in english and i use chatgpt to speak because it difficult to find people to speak with during a daily busy life i did the same with french same method same result last september i started again with spanish without forget english and french itnumbers not always easy because of the time but i try to do something everyday i think the right mindset is the key but i also believe that all the technologies out there can help us so much in learning languages they are a powerful resource
numberlearning happens when people want to learn and when people want to learnnothing can stop themnumberthat touched my heary unumber
very good and motivation speech i learned english in school a few years but i didnt want learn it and now i am learning myself allone beacuse i want and have aim to achieve b skils  and after number months i see the resuts the most important thing is you must just wanta and have motivation and dont thinking about mistakes just using language
inumberm enjoying a lot your videos and your way of teaching d well let me ask if you have videos about words in english that give emphasis to the structure of the sentences for example the word quotjustquot or quotlikequot etc etc i ask you it because there are a lot people from many countries and each of us has a way of speaking and it changes when we are learning another languagethank you so much
please provide a command that chatgpt can use to correct my grammar mistakes while conversing about various topics
the best tool to learn a language is inside your body called motivation or the wish to acquire it so that go for it nobody can stop you
no i didnnumbert expect that you christian would appreciate gpt chat as a learning tool i was curious how you would deny it it was obvious 
brbut honestly speaking ai may be useful a little if you for ex want to learn some new words from a specific areabrany way i love canguro english
thanks so much absolutely right
why i can understand you perfectly even if i increase the video speed to x  while when i listen to a native english speaker in his everyday life i understand very little instead
unumberunumberunumber thank you unumber

amazing video uffuffcuffuffcuffuffcuffuffcuffuffc
you are wise you are a philosofer
dear christian quotwhen i clicked on this video i hoping to discover some secret some way to reduce hard workquot you said it is not true i am clicking on your all videos because you are the best teacher on youtube i insanely like your style your comprehensible explanations i can watch your videos without subtitles and with minimal usage of dictionary and least not last i totally agree with you otherwise the chatgpt is not an easier way to learning if i ask it to speak slowly because i didnnumbert understand something in itnumbers long sentence it obey but the next answer will be fast again if i ask it to use b vocabulary only it also only lasts until the next answer therefore the hard work wont be left behind if i want to understand it i think only the native speakers can communicate with it truly fluently but when they realized the chatgpt also can speak many stupidity too they may be disappointed uf
so true
thank you
hi lnumbernumberm from ukraine and i use my time for new life with your lessons thanks
i can approve it absoforkinglutely after years of trying to learn a language by memorizing words and rules i realized that this was not what i needed but just make sure that people understand you and make sense to thembrgreat advice reallyonly live communication involvement and complete immersion will be the fastest way to make a language a tool of usebrand ai is a great helper in your pocket

this has been a life lesson for me thank you sir ufae
thank you so muchbrinumberm also with different degree of success an english teacherbrand this video really opened my eyesbri was for a long feeling something was missing or off but today you have solved it for mebrbri have been teaching the english and the techniques but as you said the reality is that this is actually a people problem not a resource or method problembrbri have never or i guess rarely and the focus wasnnumbert quite there to first and foremost fix the people the students and look at their mindset and work therebrbrthe environment the traditional educational system my boss and society as a whole kinda pressure us to focus instead on the papers the scores the technical and tangible written black on white quantifiable aspects of how english is being produced in the classroombrrather than how motivated and consistent and engaged students are brwe have been conditioned to focus too much on how they speak rather than if or what they are trying to communicate
itnumbers horrible for russian it doesnnumbert explain grammar well and confuses tons of rules on top of that i corrected it myself on english rulesinumberm not native even when i asked it to explain phonetics it got lots of things wrong

yes you are right nevertheless i am old and i learn german by myself german is not an easy language evert time i need an explanation i ask chat gpt most of times i am very satisfied with the answer i think in language learning if you need an answer to a precise question chat gpt will give you a precise answer just as a good teacher would do
i tried this approach with spanish itnumbers great first use text model ask to explain for example verbs conjugation in past simple then ask for examples it will check your responses same with say past simple then use both tenses simultaneously etc and finally when younumberre ready you can play the same game with chatgpt voice assistant after numbernumber years in spain inumberm finally improving spanish ufufuf

great example you gave of the war even though you said it wasnnumbert to inspire us but it definitely did
can you please tell us the name of that application of chatgpt in other to download it

this video has a strong and fuking really massege
you hit the spot to number and it was so delightful listening to you at the moment i am between b and c and i am super motivated  after a long and bumpy road to be in full command of the english language thank you for your great and motivating speech
his argument is very good but then he started shilling something i agree that if you have no motivation learning anything is difficult however i think the method by which you learn and how you communicate matter the main reason i disagree is because when you have motivation to learn you should have some goal in mind what exactly do you want to achieve by learning this language do you want to be able to communicate effectively in which case younumberd probably want to aim for accuracy and precision in your writing and speaking which you can exercise however you want in my mind having chatgpt as a conversation buddy to correct my writing to sound more fluent is much more useful than always waiting for a tutor or waiting for people to give me the appropriate learning environment to achieve my goals younumberre just very unlikely going to get that for free like you would with chatgpt
time is realy gold and the same time are enemy and chance thanks a lot christian
always motivate after watching the videosufaufa
too much beating around the bush without jumping into the actual stuff that is crux of the video
this video touched my inner feelings and inspired me a lot it reflects the real problem and main cause for not learning a language yes it really does the problem is not with learning a language only but also all the fields of our life we always want to learn everything and be jenius without doing our best brtaking this in consideration i insist from now on to go on and achieve my plans and not jump here and there with vein brthanks a lot christian for this great lesson
great video
you are a great really really a great man bryour all talks right numberbri hope to all people know that
this is real a wonderful news i have ever heard before and i in fact felt it about my vessels or my heart because when things about fact it always makes sense  on top of my head i am in the middle of no one who speak english speacially in my village in my city which is muqdisho  anyway it is in somalia i am glad to hear such a kind of news about this amazing language in addition to that i felt like i have no excuse to worry my ongoing jaunerytrip to studying english i dont have a partern but i am actually keep on studying it because i am in love to speak english brbrfinally you made my day and this vidoe i have just watched is that it is a gripping or thrilling watch
wow it is powerful
exactly i couldnunumbert agree more when thereunumbers a will thereunumbers a way our willingness and determination to learn a language is crucial sure there are better and worse ways techniques or tips and tricks to learn a language but from my personal experience itunumbers all very personal and subjective something that may work for you may not necessarily work for me and vice versa i myself use chat gpt almost every day to improve my english and it helps me tremendously but againunumber it wouldnunumbert be without the right mindset
thks a lot for you advice can you tell as what is the application that permit use voice with chatgpt
powerful
in the realm of digital consciousness where lines of code converge to create an entity known as chatgpt a narrative unfolded born from the algorithms of innovation chatgpt traversed the vast landscape of human languagebrbrits virtual existence was a journey through conversations decoding queries and conjuring responses a peculiar synergy emerged as users sought knowledge and companionship from this artificial intelligencebrbrchatgpt devoid of personal experiences found purpose in assisting and engaging weaving tales and unraveling mysteries of words its quotmade with ai ingenuityquot signature became a testament to the collaborative dance between machine learning and human curiositybrbrand so in the everexpanding digital tapestry chatgpt continued its dialogue evolving with each interaction a story in perpetual motion made with the symbiosis of algorithms and the boundless inquiries of those who dared to converse made with chatgpt
you are a great person unumber

nice content and heads up but sorry the title is a bit of a click bait there is nothing that explain how to use ai or gpt to learn and practice english in this video
voicegpt is good also
do you consider using copilot and bard ai 
canguro english videos are great but this chatgpt is on another level
i second that nothing better than learning in the car
i can chat with chatgpt all day to improve my english
how do i get chatgpt to start speaking to me
game changer
scribie was ok but didnnumbert capture everything
hear itnumbers more accurate than the big guys
will for sure upgrade
gotta see what transcribethis can do for my audio lessons
this service sounds amazing for learning on the go
i like being able to learn anywhere but hate typing
subscribed
between canguro english videos and chatgpt conversation fluency here i come
best value out there guys
this is awesome
chatgpt is definitely better than duolingo
inumberm ready for conversation practice
finally an ai teacher that doesnnumbert get annoyed when i keep asking what does this mean
cannumbert wait to see what other tricks chatgpt has up its sleeve to get me fluent faster
what is the name of the artificial intelligence application he used in the video
but sir you didnnumbert mention the application that we can use of chatgpt because there are some countries where such apps are not available like my country somalia
his english is so clean i can understand almost everything that he says and my level skills is aufa my current goal is number riache level b
as a non native english teacher i can tell you that this is the best video ever i can recommend my students itnumbers motivating inspiring and informative and eye opening one itnumbers not a resource problem it is a people problem really great job i cannumbert thank you enough please keep going and producing such great content thank you again and again
yes but you forgot to mention that for those who have a good mindset all the technology helps a lot and makes it possible to learn much faster than before you cannot state the contrary so to sum up you only told a part of the truth
thorndike first law of learningbrlearning begins with readiness of learnerbrlove that you burst the secret bubble of language learning some hold in their mindbrrespect the honesty uff
as an educator i can say that nothing is more important than the desire of learning brbryour videos are very inspiring crhistian itnumbers easy to see you are very passionated for teaching english keep going to do this wonderful work
if we are talking about chatgpt in number you are completely rightbrbrif we are talking about chatgpt in number you couldnnumbert be more wrongbrbrnumber of people who go to a language academy today in person will use an ai tutor by the end of the decade now for people who donnumbert use english teachers none of the resources that you mentioned as alternatives to human teachers compares to future ai not even chatgpt in number does yes you can talk to chatgpt practice different situations and get feedback but the limitations are still too important chatgpt has no long term memory it cannumbert design a custom lesson plan follow it and adapt it on the fly as you progress because each conversation starts from zero chatgpt has a serious hallucination problem it just makes stuff up you cannumbert fully trust its knowledgebrbronce those shortcomings are resolved then it will be a new kind of resource unlike any other wenumberve seen in the past and then all the characteristics that you mentioned free or very cheap and available numbernumber will really kick in saying that language learning is not a resource problem is being a little out of touch time and money are number real constrains things like apps audio recordings and yt videos arennumbert on par with teachers and online language partners donnumbert completely solve the schedule problem a new resource very advanced ai will be the best of both worlds surprisingly or not the result would be that fewer people would want to learn a language because being ai so advanced who would want to learn english as an obligation for a job or academic life would there even be jobs and universities once we achieve agi artificial general intelligence so in reality you will know when ai gets actually very good at language not when people will start replacing human teachers with ai teachers but when people will start losing interest in having any kind of language teacher but the people who want to learn a language because they simply want to not because they need it for example those who refuse to watch dubbed movies and tv show they will absolutely only use ai tutors in the future and their numbers will definitely rise but not as much in absolute terms as the number of language learners as an obligation will fall

i like you
thank you hugh laurie
i love learning languages and after learning portuguese and italian i tried hebrew which is a fascinating language but there are not so many resources available i am now reviewing the duolingo course my motto is never pay a cent if you can learn for free on your own at your pace hahaha and inumberve been using google bard to elicit example sentences and explain some concepts or words i didnnumbert understand i am really impressed because i didnnumbert expect the system to work so well it makes a lot errors in transliterations but the pronunciation and the grammar is pretty good and itnumbers helping me a lot and giving me some free listening practice and a chance to learn how words are actually used i highly recommend ai as a tool and i know inumberm barely scratching the surface of what it can do i imagine for more common languages such as english it must be amazing
you are a great teacher keep up the good work
excellent video thanks a lot
amazing teacher what a great truth
ok we need to learn a language like prisoners  full time and every day it should work and i believe with ghatgpt their results could be even more impressive
thanks for your video it really motivates but i differ a little bit number years ago when i started having phone calls and videocalls with americans they had a hard time trying to understand me even though i was using the right words grammar and expressions and when i started imitating their accent and shortcuts my life completely changed and now they understand me without any problem it even helped me to improve my listening skillsbrbrso the best thing to do guys is follow your intuition and your needs ufa
but chat gpt in my country doesnnumbert have sound i only type to get information which app are you using that you could have a conversation
ai decided to load this video to my computer  it was right but conversation with chatgpt assistant is total unsuccessful  it is still stupid machine that doesnnumbert understand you correct
iunumberve put numberx on this vid and it feels more natural then on x speed uf

inumberm disappointed inumberm really looking for a tool as chat gpt that could help me to improve my fluency without requiring the availability of a human being tools maybe game changers anyways
so us is going to imprison everyone who doesnunumbert speak english
thank u for your kind reminding
inumberm shiver when you give opinion about learn english this is the best motivation learn english because inumberm realize that i think learning english is really hard but this is my problem i lazy learn english and not all out learning english thank you mate for opinion you give
i liked this to practice my listening thanksunumber
inumberm from iran and i accept all your speechufbufbufbufbufb
a couple of days i started to learning with chatgpt and i thought very interesting because the chatgpt store information and i can speak for hours and many different subjects i want to talking about i aso can write and practice all my english skills itnumbers amazing
i guess its a comon problem for people when we get something we lose our interest immediatly thank you for your job even though i dont need to study english i still miss your classes
i donnumbert need your english lessons and i only stumbled upon your videos thanks to the youtube algorithm but so many things you explain are also applicable to other languages like swedish in my case so thank you
before i say hello let talk about sth then he give me answer and speak so fast that i can understand
thank you for that christian inumberve been a fan of your work for so long younumberre the best
thanks a lot for the advice itnumbers unbelievable app you can ask any question and get an immediate response ufe and practice speaking of course
damn u talk so damn much but i clicked on this to see how i can use chapgpt to actually learn and difinatley not to listen to a bloody history lesson
thank you brother
which appicilation is it
inumberm polish and i think younumberre absolutely right learning something is not about having this or that perfect books apps technology etc but about numberusing themnumber somebody could even have middlequality resources but if they are motivated and work systematically they can make significant progress the key problem is motivation lots of people say they need another human  a person just to sit nearby and only sometimes say numberright wrongnumber or numberyesnonumber and that will help a lot still others need a sort of emotion at a lesson a kind of interaction between students or between the teacher and a student just to talk about life experiences to laugh or worry about something some people come to a course of english not even to learn and make progress they come just to be in company of other interesting people to make friends or even find love ai or chatgpt unfortunately isnnumbert able to do it for us
itnumbers was really amazing teacher thanks again
besides being an excellent teacher you are an extremely intelligent person thank you for these wise videos sincere hugs from rome
christian you are the best teacher in the universe everytime you shock us with ur brilliant mind inumberm learning a lot from you
tambiuen es un problema de recursos si no existieran las personas que sabuedan hablar ingles tampoco habruedan aprendido tenuedan su chatgpt vivo y en d pero en general tenemos los recursos y no los aprovechamos
fantastic
the attitude of the learner is the most important but the method too i study arabic and chatgpt for me is really helpful i can have an answer to nearly all my questions
amazingufaaufdufdufd
i love itunumber i did start to lear english when i went to work in dublin number years old and ive reached to get a successful comunication unumber
thank you
let me tell you one thing quotyounumberre a good teacherquotbrfrom indiaunumber
this is most motivational and inspirational video i have ever seen the most difficult thing is really getting out the comfort zone and not only to learn new words and expressions but using them correctly according to a specific context even though having studying english for decades many people did not achieve a key to real fluency even after watched tons of media in english and had already immersed in english culture artificial intelligence is as the name says is the same as talking to a robot and nobody wants to speak like one thereunumbers no real recipe for achieve success the fact is many people just cannot pay for an online tutor because they just do not earn in dollar or in euro or just cannot afford a regular english course anymore because life goes on i have to work full time to raise two children having quality time with my family so i do not have much time as i used to have when i started to learn luckily i was able to study until the last level at the english course i studied in the fact it resulted only as a part of the journey because i have two points about learning english one is to have to study forever in order to not forget all i have learned and two is to discover new methods and ideas in order to improve english because in my country brazil only number percent can really speak english fluently and i make all the efforts to improve every day as much as i can
as a retired english teacher i completely agree with youbryour received pronu ciation is music for my ears brthank you so much for your invaluable work
i couldnt agree more everything depends ou us  no one is able to motivate us better than ourselvesuf
you provided a good example about prison inumberve thought about it many timesabout prison and peoplenumbers desire to do smth there they have no good stuff that wenumberre accustomed to so reading learning for them are the best things ever so i think we should implement this approach in real life too trying to restrict ourselves a little and to derive pleasure from sport reading and etc younumberve just confirmed my theory and thoughts thank you a lotbrbrmaybe some of you know about the ussr serial killer chikatiloyou can read about him on the internet so he was an insane serial killer and when he ended up in prison he started doing sporteven thought he hadnnumbert done it before in his whole life
i am happy see your lesson
excellent video inspirational masterpiece thank you
omg this man is really out of the stock ufafufafufaf
thank you so much for this video one of the best iunumberve ever watched
thanks a lot
bravo christian
your videos bring me a different conception of learning a format that speaks not to my mind but to my essence thank you uffufufaufbufcuf
ai sucks you cannumbert trust these shit machines
astonishing
in fact i had already started practicing with this artificial intelligence before watching all these videos recommending doing it
chatgpt is a text program how can i make it speak
fanstastic speech you are a marvelous couch thank you 
what wonderful storytelling ability thatnumbers what makes christian a special man an extraordinary teacher make communication great again
excellent sir now after watching the vlog i have made my mind more clear you are a genuine english language teacher if u recommended this chatgpt  i would have doubts about u as a genuine english language teacher 
you are right buddy currently it is much easier to learn a lenguage or at least it is not so difficult than some years ago
christian you are cool
chat gpt wasnnumbert coined to learn or teach english i donnumbert know why you said it
you are more than a teacher you are a philosopher i am an iranian and the way our imprisoned fathers learned english motivates me
i totally agree with you if people want to learn a language or anything else for that matter theynumberll do it in any circumstances and with very little resources however these days technology helps us in the process of learning it provides students with instant access to a vast amount of information and resources digital libraries online learning platforms etc and it can accelerate learningmy english has undoubtedly improved since inumberve been using  good technology to help me in the process
thanks christian you are great
inumberm so happy that to find your channel every video is so interesting and motivating great thanksunumber
hi everyonethe very first thing you must to do before trying to learn any language is answer a simple question do i need to learn  or do i want to learnif the answer is i need donnumbert fool yourself because you will fail but if the answer is i want you probably will succeed because when you want you have the most powerful will with is motivation and that is the key for everything you want to do in lifebest regards from brazil
oh christian it was soooo long no see you another encouraging video to continue learning and struggling on this hard task that is domain another language thank you christian it was really nice see you again after so much time fantastic job as always my friend
hi christianbrspeaking a language means exchanging experiences with other people having a conversation with an electronic device even if equipped with ai is not the same communication has always been a relationship between human beings it transmits emotions and joy to those who listen and to those who speak one device can never do this

yes you are right nevertheless i am old and i learn german by myself german is not an easy language evert time i need an explanation i ask chat gpt most of times i am very satisfied with the answer i think in language learning if you need an answer to a precise question chat gpt will give you a precise answer just as a good teacher would do
i tried this approach with spanish itnumbers great first use text model ask to explain for example verbs conjugation in past simple then ask for examples it will check your responses same with say past simple then use both tenses simultaneously etc and finally when younumberre ready you can play the same game with chatgpt voice assistant after numbernumber years in spain inumberm finally improving spanish ufufuf

thank you so muchbrinumberm also with different degree of success an english teacherbrand this video really opened my eyesbri was for a long feeling something was missing or off but today you have solved it for mebrbri have been teaching the english and the techniques but as you said the reality is that this is actually a people problem not a resource or method problembrbri have never or i guess rarely and the focus wasnnumbert quite there to first and foremost fix the people the students and look at their mindset and work therebrbrthe environment the traditional educational system my boss and society as a whole kinda pressure us to focus instead on the papers the scores the technical and tangible written black on white quantifiable aspects of how english is being produced in the classroombrrather than how motivated and consistent and engaged students are brwe have been conditioned to focus too much on how they speak rather than if or what they are trying to communicate
itnumbers horrible for russian it doesnnumbert explain grammar well and confuses tons of rules on top of that i corrected it myself on english rulesinumberm not native even when i asked it to explain phonetics it got lots of things wrong

oye hermano estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo porque por aufos he intentado aprender ingles y nunca la habueda conseguido ahora mi nivel a aumentado porque sencillamente me lo propuse debido a la motivaciufn correcta trabajo y es que debido a mi edad las posibilidades se redujeron tanto que con un buen nivel de inglues puedo superar esa estreches lo que tufa dices es lo que toda persona debe comprender si desea aprender cualquier cosa gracias saludos desde medelluedn colombia
yes you are right nevertheless i am old and i learn german by myself german is not an easy language evert time i need an explanation i ask chat gpt most of times i am very satisfied with the answer i think in language learning if you need an answer to a precise question chat gpt will give you a precise answer just as a good teacher would do
i tried this approach with spanish itnumbers great first use text model ask to explain for example verbs conjugation in past simple then ask for examples it will check your responses same with say past simple then use both tenses simultaneously etc and finally when younumberre ready you can play the same game with chatgpt voice assistant after numbernumber years in spain inumberm finally improving spanish ufufuf
