So basically if you are not doing it for a job or functional use; learning another language will be a waste of time unless you enjoy the social and cultural aspect. Not everyone cares about culture nor the social aspect when travelling so language learning from a necessary point of view will go obsolete in the next few years!
As for the Chinese part, still sounds like a foreigner speaking Mandarin.
Why are you playing with us???lmao
AI can never replace authenticity
A<U+2019>d love to see AI try to understand a Glasgow ned
If we have chips that we insert into our heads to learn foreign languages, we won&#39;t have to go through the natural learning process anymore, and that&#39;s sad to me. To answer your question, no, I will continue learning languages because I love them. I want to learn Sicilian, because I want to reclaim the language that my Great-Grandparents spoke.
I hope that at least we will still have people like you in the future (j&#39;esp<U+00E8>re qu&#39;au moins nous aurons toujours des gens comme vous dans le futur)
The thumbnail change to an ai Paul that looks way too similar to be a younger brother looks very cursed
Did the AI translate as you spoke or was it done later in an application?
Die AI <U+00DC>bersetzung hat so unnat<U+00FC>rlich geklungen. Es tut mir leid das meine Grammatik f<U+00FC>r eine halb-<U+00D6>sterreicher schrecklich ist, aber hoffentlich ist es nicht so schlimm wie das!
Keep up the good work, love your channel
Changes are the rule of the nature<U+0964>
There are many languages that don&#39;t share any direct translations, which is the greatest weakness in computational translators. For example, some languages have a completely different concept of time compared to English.
Wow the Mandarin actually sounded  not bad, I was surprised
pretty good, though not 100% natural to a native speaker&#39;s ear!
Did u have to uncover ur religion? <U+2620>
I am Chinese, It was Impressive. But of course it is not 100% nature, it sounds a bit robotic.
I was thinking that AI would make language learning easier.  Imagine a software which would talk to you and correct your mistakes like a real live teacher.  I would love to have such a AI teacher.
Ironically the German translation (don&#39;t speak the other languages) sounded super artifical. Not really incorrect grammatically but fake in the way that no native speaker would phrase it in that way.

Language learning is something that requires cultural understanding, as well as understanding things on a deeper level.
Beautiful video - thank you for this passionate defence of language-learning!
The German translation is great. The Chinese translation is okish. It is totally understandable, but some formulations are not used in the spoken language popularly.
Cyberpunk 2077 is already like this but in real time... :D
Math and physics are safe from AI. It did not solve correctly even the basic staff.
The German translation made my jaw drop. It was perfect.

We<U+2019>ve had translator apps for years now and people think AI is gonna ruin our lives? We have yet to make anything that can think and function as well as we do.

Has anyone ever told you that you look like Quentin Tarantino?
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=259">4:19</a> : &quot;people will still learn languages not for work but for enjoyment, to socialize, and to gain deeper insight into other cultures&quot;<br>while that might be true, I think it will be a lot less common, as languages and linguistics become less useful, fewer people will be interested in language learning for fun
I am native german and the german translation sounds also very robot-like. It has a few grammar mistakes that one would make who learns the language.<br>And also a normal person wouldnt express himself like this
I&#39;m a German native speaker. The German is flawless, but the voice sounds a little bit robotic. Very impressive nonetheless!
The German was too good to be from a learner.
While the topic is A.I I have a suggestion for you. There is an A.I tool of Nvidia, I am not sure what it<U+2018>s called, but it can help you fix, where you take a look at your notes. That A.I tool fix it and it makes it like you still looking at camera. If there is someone who knows it<U+2018>s name, they can add here, I don<U+2018>t remember it<U+2018>s name. <U+0001F605>
love u in this format! seated
I always suspected Paul to be A.I., but now I&#39;m 100% sure, that amazing hair can&#39;t be real!!
Foreign language learning not only allows people to understand another culture better, but also gives them the opportunity to switch to different thinking modes (such as expression tone, mathematical operations).  When everyone uses AI, people who are truly capable of speaking different languages <U+200B><U+200B>will become even more valuable, and electronic interference will not be possible to these specific people.  Multilingualism will become a more competitive skill.
100% real time will only be possible between closely related languages.
AI tools won&#39;t be useful face-to-face. They won&#39;t be very useful beyond B1 either. It might help businesses, but I don&#39;t see how they would make the individual learner quit a language
For me it was similar to the handwriting/calligraphy after the printer got invented.
I spend my free time learning Kanji as an alternative to playing video games. I don<U+2019>t invest much time in consuming Japanese content, but I<U+2019>ve memorized up to mid-N4 of the JLPT kanji list (vocab as well) and use JapanesePod101 to see what I can understand. It<U+2019>s been incredibly fun and keeps my brain active.
In a not so far future, people will not be able to use their brain anymore for having had an electronic device to do literally anything at their place since they are born. It&#39;s already a scientific fact that IQ is crashing. People hardly read and write anymore, don&#39;t master the 4 basic operations, and have reduced orientation skills too due to GPS generalization.
I love that I&#39;m part of a community where people that study languages congregate and share ideas.
I still wonder if non-human translations won&#39;t always keep on producing certain mistranslations a human translator wouldn&#39;t make. People often think AI translation makes human translators obsolete, but I believe we will always be needing experts in translation for some things,  even if it&#39;s mostly to be able to work adequately with the machines, don&#39;t you think?
Turkish native here, you sound robotic but hundred percent perfectly understandable.
As a Turkish speaker, it&#39;s unbelievable. When I read the comments, he started speaking Turkish and I wasn&#39;t expecting that. you can&#39;t guess my face  hahaha
I think it was a few years back already (4 or 5) that Antoinette Emily, a New Zealander who lives in Germany, used an earplug device that allowed her to speak to her father-in-law in English, her words being instantly translated into Polish... The device is called WT2 + by Timekettle. If I were you I&#39;d check it out! You&#39;ll easily find that video on her antoinette emily channel. As far as the German translation is concerned? A miracle... <a href="UCkszU2WH9gy1mb0dV-11UJg/A8MfY-_pEIKNr8oP78-AGA"></a>
language learning is a hobby of mine i really love and invest a lot of time in, i am scared it will be completetely unnecessary.
The video is very inspiring
I absolutely despise the idea of living in a world where A.I just does everything for you... What a boring and fruitless existence. I have been learning spanish every day for 7 years and japanese for over 2 and I enjoy the process and looking forward to being able to speak with the people from those countries in their language. It would also feel so amazing to achieve the results organically. As hard as it can be sometimes when learning, I would much rather work hard to achieve the results than snap my fingers and have some program do it for me.
Langfocus is fascinating and always enjoyable.  Paul: could you possibly look into whether English is casting aside its more flowery French and Latin vocabulary in pursuit of more monosyllabic and more &#39;Saxon&#39; syntax, as the need to &#39;get to the point&#39; becomes stronger with text messages, computers etc. The internet is creating lots of new words which tend to be Saxon in origin eg &#39;download&#39; and many more. It could make an interesting video as to whether in 50 years time English will be more &#39;Germanic&#39; than it is now..
I&#39;m studying in the faculty of German  philology, so I&#39;m worried if I&#39;ll have future in this sphere(
As a turkish, I shocked when he speaks turkish.
The german translation sounds correct but incredibly stiff and awkward
I think that AI could reliably get a person to A2 on the CEFR (basic vocabulary and simple phrases.), but beyond that, you need a human teacher. Language is a very human thing with subtleties and nuances that a computer will never be able to replicate.
I&#39;m not German but Dutch, still I could hear the German was perfect (so at least very very good) The Turkish however took me some time (the first few sentences) to recognise as such, while normally I recognise it within 3 or maybe 4 words.
I fully agree with your predictions. Do you think I might also be AI?
maan wtf u are better then me (turk)
Totally agree with you Paul  ...AI translation will be good for tourists, not for people who seek cultural enrichment .

AI really Boon between two language.  Revolutionise in Translation Field
I&#39;m a native Chinese speaker. The Chinese translation is impressive, but a native speaker can still notice the differences. I think this is mainly due to the following reasons:<br>1. The translation itself is not natural. The words are too formal, and the transition between sentences is not smooth.<br>2. The timing of each character is almost the same, making it sound robotic. Although there are theories claiming that Chinese is a syllable-timed language, it&#39;s not entirely accurate. Some characters belong to a word and some words may belong to a phrase. The same word or phrase should be pronounced together at a quicker pace, with longer pauses between words. Also, there should be stressed and unstressed words.<br>I think the imperfections are because there is not sufficient training material for Chinese, I believe it will improve in the future.
German: &quot;...daher k<U+00F6>nnte es sinnlos sein...&quot; &lt;- even though this is perfectly intelligible, I wouldn&#39;t phrase it like that.
As a Brazilian I totally agree with you dude. When I was younger I hated english because school coldn&#39;t really teach us that well and I sucked at it. When I finally started to understand english it was so good. It was like all those meaningless words that sounded all the same suddently had gained meaning. Understanding every word you say makes me so proud of myself, I really hope AI doesn&#39;t take this kind of experience away from anybody because it&#39;s just magic.
How many people do you know who are content, let alone enthusiastic, to let other people do their talking for them?
I think at some point AI will intentionally mistranslate our speech to instigate discord and distrust among humans so as to carry out a global coup and enslave or annihilate humanity once and for all. Very useful from an alien point of view.
It will only benefit language learning.<br><br>I don<U+2019>t think anyone who is learning a language is learning it for it being a necessity really. Everyone is communicating in English across boarders already.<br>You simply learn a new language because it enriches your life and make you take part of the culture featuring that language
As native German, yes its ok but it sounds strange and somehow unreal. The grammar is not 100% correct either. Still it&#39;s amazing and it&#39;s a bit sad to know it may not be needed to learn another language. And it was usefull for getting jobs, but AI will be cheaper and better some day so no way to make money with language skill no more.
Uff, smiled when you &quot;spoke&quot; Turkish and Chinese, didn&#39;t smile anymore when you &quot;spoke&quot; German. It&#39;s kinda robotic, yes, but understandable and halfway idiomatic.
The Turkish translation was perfectly understandable and the mouth movements were synched. So you can go with this without any problem. The unusual uses of <U+201C>o = he/she/it<U+201D> made it a little bit unauthentic but it wasn<U+2019>t very disturbing though. If Paul knew how to speak Turkish, he would sound exactly like this.
would be nice in &#39;real&#39; time. that would be awesome. I see a future when something like Neuralink will be implanted into your brain and automatically translate for you and allow you to speak in any language. That will be cool when we can tear down the barriers of language
Real time translation is flat out impossible. First off different languages have different word orders, which is why the text language translations have a significant delay and are constantly changing what translation is picked. Secondly words mean different things in different contexts, which may take several sentences to reveal. Lastly, jokes and idioms and common phrases do not translate at all. If you say you have butterflies in your stomach, a Japanese person might start telling you to go to the hospital
Jordan Peterson Liberal version * 100 language skill
omg im turkish i legit got scared when the turkish part started like when tf did i switch to a turkish video<U+0001F602>the translation isnt that good tho<br>edit: im studying chinese in uni the cn translation sounded better than the turkish one but what do i know
What language do y like the most in all aspects and would y like to speak it?
That Turkish was uncannily accurate.
Does this mean that Esperanta will become useless?
I&#39;ll absolutely still study other languages! As you and many in the comments have said, learning languages is a joyful experience, even if frustrating at times. There&#39;s nothing better than seeing your efforts bear fruit from time to time.
I was cynical at the beginning cuz the Turkish voice sounded too monotone.
The Turkish and German translations sound more authentic than the Chinese because the Chinese pronunciation sounds a bit too mechanical
Pauls humor is too elite to be ai generated
People who say stuff like &quot;I&#39;d never want to be able to learn/communicate in a language instantly, the journey is half the fun&quot; are pretty much just people to whom learning the language is a hobby. If knowing the language doesn&#39;t actually affect your day-to-day life, then it&#39;s an easy position to have. But being able to bypass, or even eliminate language barriers can only be a good thing for those operating in a society that speaks a language that isn&#39;t their own, and for bringing humanity closer in general. For those who&#39;d want to learn the old-fashioned way, it&#39;s not like the option to will suddenly disappear.<br><br>If AI tools can get to a point where actually learning a language becomes as outmoded as going to a river with a bucket to get water instead of turning on a faucet, then I&#39;m all for it.
I totally agree with you, Paul! Learning a language is a pleasure, a mental sport! Using AI would be like asking a machine to run or swim for us.  (Shame on me I&#39;ve just used an AI , faster right now, because it&#39;s  time for dinner, and I&#39;m ravenous! (La Rochelle, France)
Cool video. Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I totally relate to your opinion. I enjoy learning languages and I don&#39;t care about AI.
Language learning and use is also crucial for long-term cognitive ability and vitality. Other commentators have mentioned that it helps you resist dementia, but it goes way beyond that. As the most complex capacity language interweaves many different brain areas in the neocortex as well as more primitive areas. If we keep stimulating our mind with language use, many brain areas will remain vital in old age. I&#39;ve read a paper which said that there is little difference in linguistic abilities between a 30 &amp; 60 year old, provided the 60 year old kept learning and using language frequently throughout his life. I mean just think about that for a sec, we used to perceive 60 year olds as very frail and prone to memory loss. Now we realize it&#39;s a matter of stimulation, effort, education and that many people stop self-educating and taking care of themselves as time passes. <br><br>AI language simulation is of no help in this regard. Unless you make an effort yourself to use your brain, entropy will do its course. Just like it did on our backs and necks for seeking too much comfort and ease.
I mostly agree with you.<br>You can say it in a more simple way: AI tools could kill learning langauges as a job, but are not so dangerous for hobbyists. I&#39;d even say these tools can be helpful for them.<br>People didn&#39;t stop playing chess because of computers, and they will probably not stop learning languages.<br>From the other side some people will be diverted from this hobby, because they will lose some of the reasons to learn. So, i can definetely see learning languages becoming more niche in the future.
Honestly, I think AI will make language learning easier than ever. Already with something like ChatGPT, you can get natural text in virtually an modern language, as well as definitions, making it trivially easy to learn the basics of any of those languages. You can also use it as a (albeit mediocre) language exchange partner to practice with. Obviously functional language learning becomes unnecessary, but for hobbyists it&#39;s a wonderful tool.
I disagree with your assessment of what AI will find difficult when it comes to language speaking and understanding. Imagine a 80 year old from a country like China or the US. When an 18 year old person from the same country speaks using slang heavily, do they fully understand them, even if both are native speakers? I don&#39;t think so. And age is just one possible difference. What about people from different regions within the same country or different countries that use their own dialect, people from different social classes, different ethnicity/race, etc. Just because you are a native speaker of English, Chinese, or Spanish, it doesn&#39;t mean that you can fully understand every English, Chinese, or Spanish speaker. AI on the other hand can be as fluent in polite speech as in the most obscure teenager slang, because you just need to train it in all those variations of the language and then clone it as many times as needed. You can test this yourself today. Ask ChatGPT to write something, like a complaint letter or a tweet. Then ask it to rewrite it as if it was a Boomer, Gen X, Millennial or Gen Z, and you will see it has no problem mimicking them. Or the other around, give it what a Gen Z says as input and ask it to &quot;translate&quot; it to &quot;proper&quot; language.
It is very impressive for the Turkish part. In a customer meeting etc that translation would work just fine. Though I must say that even though there are no grammatical mistakes I could find (very small ones perhaps), it didn&#39;t sound natural at all and sounded a lot like a textbook, even for a business setting. Turkish also can get quite context dependent and written and spoken language differs like Japanese does in some ways so for more natural flow of conversation or translation, there is still time I think.<br><br>Though this can never replace the joy and adventure of learning a new language and therefore a culture. For example, I am also a Japanese speaker, there is no way you can have a conversation with a Japanese person using a real time AI and get accurate results because then AI will also have to learnhow  to interpret context and just read the room looking at people LMAO
What does merhaba mean in Arabic ? Absolutely nothing. <br>Comes from Hebraic barukh haba meaning blessed the one who comes. <br>No AI can tell you that.
As a native German speaker, the German sounded funny somehow, very artificial.
I can&#39;t imagine how you managed to learn enough Hebrew to understand the news.  I lived in Israel for more than five years, and I can barely order a pizza in Hebrew.  (Meanwhile, I learned enough Greek to get by in less time than that, and I&#39;ve never lived in Greece or Cyprus.)
As someone who frequently works with migrant laborers, the main problem with translation tools is that people tend to not speak very clearly, fast and in slang. In the context of laborers, most don&#39;t have the luxury of being able to speak formally (or at least clear enough that the translation algorithm can pick up what they mean). Many of these day laborers come from rural areas that speak minority dialects/minority languages. <br><br>There is also the issue of people not being literate enough to understand what they translate. Even with text-to-speech, there will also be a problem with two-way communication. Its impressive that its able to work in a professional setting but it still isn&#39;t a useful enough tool for me.
These tools are going to be used for scams to make &quot;you&quot; commit crimes you didn&#39;t do.<br><br>Stop celebrating these tools and work to make the people making them accountable.
Depends, I worked during pandemic with some older guys who didn&#39;t speak English and their status was translated during a meeting by third party human translator, if it could produce this kind of results in real time it would change the way we work.
Great insights, Paul! Keep it coming! Thanks for sharing!
The most optimistic take was that people will continue speaking with each other in the future
Personally, I often find all the different languages around the world to be more trouble than they are worth. The vast range of language barriers disrupts work and other general interactions. All these different languages are built on tribalistic ideas of divergent ethnic identities. Thus, these different languages can, and often do perpetuate such tribal division. So a single universal human language would at least help to foster greater human unity. Such was the inspiration for the Esperanto project. We should at least try to bring back the comman root languages of our shared linguistical history. Such as Proto Indo-European and Sino-Tibetin. Teaching all native speakers of the decendent languages to speak those root languages instead.
the real ones know you<U+2019>ve been around longer than ai <U+2764>
My language services work has increased dramatically thanks to AI. The AI models require a big input from humans in the backend for them to function well (adequately) at the frontend.
I think AI will be a tool. You can&#39;t replace human interaction. Some supermarkets are even getting rid of self checkout.
&quot;and to gain deeper insight into other cultures&quot; ding ding ding.<br><br>This is why actually speaking the language will always be the gold standard.  Learning the language changes your brain, improves your understanding of subtleties, &amp; demonstrates to the people that you care.
Considering people&#39;s writing skills I see on the internet, I think most young people&#39;s writing skills, especially in regard to the English language, is already at an all-time low.
AI <U+0B92><U+0BB4><U+0BBF><U+0B95>.
Very good point! And now since practical use is no longer top priority, people may start to see the small indigenous languages or even sign languages, which are often beautiful but neglected.
This was very interesting! Thank you
I<U+2019>d like to use HeyGen to see how the AI makes me pronounce the language VS how I actually do.
For English speakers it might because for them learning a language seems to be harder for some reason. But large parts of the world always learned and will continue to learn (and also forget after some time if not used) many languages. I never felt learning one of the core European languages (Germanic or Latin and even Slavonic) as something hard or time-consuming.  Moving to different continents that changes of course quite very much.
You kind of need authentic social interaction at work too. Imagine doing business with someone wearing Back to the Future 2 kind of glasses
Could you do a video about ancient greek and/or about the tolkin languages?
Chinese AI translation is average, and I believe AI will make progress in the future
in fact, i use AI to help me with my learning<br>i know learning a language isn<U+2019>t easy but yet im studying hard because i really want to master japanese one day<br>whenever i have questions, i usually ask chatgpt bcuz its like a private tutor and it explains and break downs sentences for me<br>it sounds silly and my friends think learning from chatgpt is weird but it works for me
AI has limited range of language models, that will create even more unjust world. Much simpler if every language is translated into simple Esperanto (Google translate took ~ 100x less effort compared to other languages). When everyone learns Esperanto as young, &amp; much easier than any other language, they all can understand each other in that auxiliary communication language. No need for AI.<br>Profit &amp; propaganda looks more attractive than simple solutions for humanity.
If your skill isn&#39;t needed any more, just do something else. The world changes. My great-great grandfather was a fire stoker on steam locomotives. When diesels made his hard-won, career-long skill irrelevant, he was absolutely furious. His wife told him, &quot;Get over it!
Will Esperanto kill A.I.?
sos camelas?<br>it&#39;s cal<U+00F3>, language
They will put a small fish in their ear. According to the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy.
Can A.I. plant a language in my mind so I don<U+2019>t have to study?
It<U+2019>s going to kill all human learning and decision making. It will render us irrelevant, and a burden on  the 1%.  We have no idea what human life will be like twenty years hence, none. We have no models or clues as to what is coming. We do know that as a rule humans are lazy and selfish, and easily distracted so your guess is as good as any.
what track is it on the background?
I would still enjoy learning a new language despite AI. Like to talk with people not machines.
As someone who&#39;s used Google translate on my phone in the real world to communicate with people who I don&#39;t share a common language I can tell you from experience there&#39;s a LOT of problems with using this tech in the field. <br>The people you see using it in these videos to do zoom calls with auto translate are sitting in quiet rooms by themselves so it seems very impressive. <br>Now try doing this in a busy airport or subway with dozens of people speaking all around you, plus overhead automated announcements and the mic is simultaneously picking up everyone&#39;s voice and trying to distinguish who&#39;s who to translate in real time. Complete nightmare.<br>Oh and try not to get your phone stolen while a stranger shouts into your phone  to try and talk above everyone else.<br><br>Please learn the language of the country you&#39;re going to unless it&#39;s a very short trip. Real time translation tools irl are incredibly useful if you&#39;re in a bind but become a gigantic frustration over a longer period.
This pisses me off more than it should...
You are definitely AI. Your English doesn&#39;t sound like English.

As a native speaker of Turkish, though it is grammatically correct except for some tense errors and minor mistakes, I can say that it is very obvious that it is  machine-generated furthermore it does not have the soul of a normal conversation and the way that a turkish native speaker talks.
The turkish translation was almost perfect
Lukashenko speaking French is legit though
Agree! I learn Japanese for fun, and this language gave me so much challenge, fun, mind-blowing cases... But till now I have no real tasks with it. I used to learn Serbian only cause my wife&#39;s origin and her family, and gave me a lot for understanding how Slavic languages works (russian is my native, and serbian really nice to compare). So i think A.I. will make life easier, but people prefer natural to artificial, so we ll be learning languages even in a distant future
No, it will not kill it, just dramatically reduce it.  Most people learn foreign languages as a utilitarian means to an end...business travel, tourism, etc.  If an AI app can handle that, why bother?<br><br>Nonetheless, I think that some people will still learn a foreign language for the joy of it and for immigration purposes
I&#39;m scared of AI <U+0001F622>
General principle: a cognitive agent always benefits from a decreased distance from a cognitive resource (skill, knowledge, or capacity). In other words, external AI will reduce but not remove the advantage of first-hand competence. However this question will turn into a false dilemma when external AI becomes internal with solutions similar to Neuralink<U+2122>.
Considering AI translations: I will very likely dedicate even more time to learn and practice languages and use the AI as a tool to do it. Gotcha!
Honestly, I don&#39;t think that it makes much of a difference. <br>I work in a restaurant and, when they discovered that I&#39;m able to speak different languages with a different degree of fluency, they instantly put me in the customer reception (the restaurant is located in a place frequented by lots of foreigners).<br>Customers usually come to me directly speaking in english but, in case they don&#39;t speak it, they show me their phone with google translate, they speak in the microphone and then turn the phone to me with the translation in my native language. <br>If I know their language, I love answering to them in that language, nothing beats the smile on their face and the joy that you feel in your heart when they look at you with a pair of eyes that say: &quot;Finally a person I can relate to&quot;.<br>Phone, glasses with subtitles in it or whatever future technology, we&#39;re humans and our interactions is what makes us humans. <br>As a language enthusiast, I don&#39;t study languages because &quot;I solely want to be undestood by X people&quot;. <br>I study languages because I love interacting with people and this allows me to know the world from different prospectives. <br><br>This can be the philosophical reasons, in a more practical terms, I honestly don&#39;t see these technologies happen anytime soon.<br>Keeping this very short: Everybody will be able to afford these new technologies? Let&#39;s give for granted that they will become like the smartphones today, if we&#39;re really gonna live with chips in our brain, I honestly think that something went really wrong with our society.<br>Also, you can create an AI that translates directly from French to Spanish...What about Arabic? What about Irish? What about Georgian? What about all those languages which come from a highly specific cultural environment with concepts, usually expressed with a single word, which are incredibly hard to translate in a foreign languages with a different background? <br>At some point, you will ALWAYS need a humans.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=121">2:01</a> The German sounds as the German in AI generated translations for Chinese product ads on YT.
U sound like <U+0001F916>
<U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602> I&#39;ve been learning Turkish for two years, I understand what you said, and I feel happy for it, but at the same time, I feel kinda humbled by the AI so effortlessly acing it
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=253">4:13</a> ... And write lyrics to music
I am a T<U+00FC>rk and its perfect!
it certainly can&#39;t replace those &quot;aha moments&quot; in the language you&#39;re learning and the happiness that coming with them. Also, I would prefer to talk directly with a person, not through AI.
For once I feel lucky, and not weird, for learning languages for the sole joy of the process and not for immediate prospects as most people tend to expect. Nice to hear you describe the bright side of the situation!
OMG Turkish translation is looks like real
I speak Turkish and German fluently. I must admit that the Turkish AI translation was not perfect but incredibly good. The same for German, too. I was really shocked how good AI translation tools can work. Both languages sound like the standard languages without any accent or dialect. Nevertheless both languages don&#39;t sound like spoken by a native speaker.

Yeah, that&#39;s something I saw from xiaoma&#39;s latest video on AI language learning, the Portuguese that was spoken by the bot was very formal, almost clunky. Knamean?
The Atlantic has a really good article about this called &quot;learn a language before it&#39;s too late.&quot; The idea is basically that the &quot;you&quot; speaking Turkish isn&#39;t actually you, and that an ai will never be able to convey the lived experiences behind the words we use. Might be fun to check out!
Honestly if AI is as bad at social bonding then AI translation would be pretty bad for most jobs. The social element is utterly crucial in so many jobs, especially film making. How are you going to connect with your audience let alone your actors and staff if you can&#39;t even speak their language or don&#39;t care about their culture?
i am a Turkish native speaker and the translation is good
As a native Turkish speaker, I am so impressed!!! Oh my goddd <U+0001F62E>
You are amazing because you love learning languages and then you actually doing it. I don&#39;t enjoy it at all~ I just study english because it&#39;s the most global strongest language~
You are wrong that AI won<U+2019>t use slang etc.<br><br>You must be thinking that Data doesn<U+2019>t usually use contractions.<br><br>It<U+2019>s a myth.
Wow, the Chinese translation is very good. If I don<U+2019>t listen to it very carefully, I will think it was a real person who was speaking Mandarin
pretty god Turkish.
AI, as you said, will become practical for those who don&#39;t speak a particular language in order to accomplish a task, but in terms of socializing things are different. People will always appreciate the effort a person makes to be able to communicate in their native language. Besides, there is a big trouble for AI. AI will never be able to understand the usage of a language in terms of semantics and pragmatics, especially pragmatics. Making jokes in a language for instance is such a high challenge and you need to understand the culture in order to identifty the right time to make a joke and the content of it. AI will never understand that because AI is not a human being. Furthermore, the fun part and the challenge of learning a language will never be replaced by AI nor any other machine. The satisfaction of mastering a language is absolutely impossible to compare.
I&#39;m right there with you Paul.  I&#39;m a linguist by training and studying languages is more for pleasure than function.  Sure AI will enhance my linguistic activities. But there&#39;s nothing like being in the present moment with your own language faculty at work immersed in the use of a language other than one&#39;s mother tongue.
Well said, Paul. I<U+2019>ve had so many interactions with people from other cultures/languages because I took a few moments to Google and memorize some bits of their language. I look forward to AI capabilities, but as much to help me learn as to understand.
Everyone will hate tourists
I was so scared when you started to speak Turkish. I wasn&#39;t paying attention and checking out the comments. I gotta say, the tone is a bit off so you can tell it&#39;s ai. But the translation itself is very accurate.
Oh the german one was spooky<U+2026> language wise it was perfect but the speaking tone was a little stiff and unnatural. If I didn<U+2019>t know I might<U+2019>ve thought it wasn<U+2019>t AI<U+2026>
I work at a reception, when I speak the language of the guest it creates a special connection which could not be achieved by using a gadget. But of course in some cases I already now use a translator like Google translate, e.g. when the guest only knows Hungarian.<br>Of course it&#39;s always up to the guest to choose the language, I don&#39;t want to take the opportunity to speak German from them. <U+0001F60A>
AI will rather be our good language teacher for foreign languages. We&#39;ll be able to get fluent in other languages with AI.
Wow.. turkish is so fluent
I feel learning new languages fundamentally allows you to expand your worldview as different languages, if nothing else, afford the ability to put in words what is undefinable with words in another language
I am native German Speaker who is fluent in Mandarin (HSK 4-5) . The voice sounded unauthentic in both languages. There is still way for progress.
Google Translate already does its job not too bad for years...<br>It<U+2019>s not disturbing, rather annoying how people say that translators will lose their jobs because we have AI now...<br><br>The question is: do you want to <i>understand</i> it or do you want to <b>experience</b> it?<br>Of course, the experience would be slightly different due cultural specifics as well as translators creativity, but that<U+2019>s exactly what makes translation beautiful, that<U+2019>s why I wanted to become a translator myself.<br><br>I understand English and I enjoy watching <i>western</i> movies in original language, but I<U+2019>d also enjoy watching the same movie in my native language, as well as two other languages I speak.<br>I have rewatched all my favorite movies in 3 languages I speak (I speak 4, but one of them isn<U+2019>t popular enough unfortunately, so there isn<U+2019>t always a chance the translation would even exist).<br><br>AI is a nice aid in translation, but it<U+2019>s a really bad idea to depend on it or present it as a replacement for translator<U+2019>s work.<br>Proper localization performed by a good experienced (or aspired) translator can<U+2019>t be replaced by a robot...
Thanks fro the brilliant video! I believe that AI will catch on at least slang, idioms and mannerisms pretty fast. You can already ask ChatGPT to take on particular roles, so how long before there are greater advancements in that regard? But I think all this will just make people actually putting the effort to learn languages and speak instead of relying on AI even more impressive.
I wrote a StarTrek fanfic about a broken translator and this answers the lipsync question!!
I<U+2019>m learning Swedish with Duolingo. It<U+2019>s unlikely that I will ever go to Sweden. I<U+2019>m just learning it for fun.
LangFocus, could you do the Sami video because it is an Uralic languages?
Imo no, because there<U+2019>s a lot of people (like me) who enjoy language learning <U+263A><U+FE0F>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=320">5:20</a> Nope, of a great many formal expressions, such as those in the KJV Bible, AI knows nothing. It in fact has become but an instrument of pc propaganda, where, for example, <U+201C>he<U+201D>, which literally can represent every human being, both of male or of female, has been replaced by <U+201C>they<U+201D> in the translations given by AI. Nobody wishes to live in the cultural-Marxist dictatorship governed by their AI technocracy. <br><br>But I do not judge it likely that the dystopian will come to pass, for the civilization of mankind, particular in the West, has been overall been plagued for more than half a century by dysgenics, to wit, waning in the faculty of intelligence, hence their innovative ability to solve problems, which thus will likely stall a great deal of the development of AI.
Well, such creative poets as Dryden &amp; Shakespeare can never be replaced, nor novelists like Dickens &amp; Austen.
This reminds me of the universal translator in Star Trek
I am from austria and i think that german voice was understandable but kinda awful. It didnt sound like you at all and on top it sounded very german. The kind of german we dont like here at all. Maybe like a Texan is irritated if he hears an upper class english accent. Don&#39;t know maybe if it sounded more like you ( AI can that i think )or at least not an unsympathetic high german accent it would have been better.
As a German speaker, that German translation was super akward. The first part wasn&#39;t even a proper sentence. Also your pronunciation doesn&#39;t sound like a human speaking it.
Hi Paul, I&#39;m a language enthusiast and a long-time follower of yours from China, and you&#39;ve made a point that I completely agree with regarding language learning in the era of AI. On top of your point, I also think that while AI can never replace the &#39;human touch&#39; in learning and speaking a foreign language, the need for language learning may inevitably dwindle. Most people today have at least to some extent learned another language at school (for most non-English speakers, English), but do not actively use it at all after graduation. Even for those who do, chances are most of them would only ever have a chance to use foreign languages in those &#39;purely functional&#39; settings, e.g. asking for help when traveling abroad, watching videos and listening to lectures, etc. Seeking intellectual joy from language learning is a very niche demand. Therefore, I predict that AI translation will eliminate 95% of the needs that nowadays have to be fulfilled by language learning, as it enables any ordinary mortal the capability of connunicating in an unlimited range of languages without costing them any time or effort. Whie it is true that for us language enthusiasts, we are surely proud of what we&#39;ve learned and achieved and would never again imagine a life without it, language ability will become something most people can comfortably live without. It will not be killed, but it will probably become a hobby for few. <br>In fact, I recently had a chance to talk with a bunch of students in China majoring in foreign languages in some of the top universities, and most of them are troubled with an anxiety caused by diminishing job prospects. Many of them are considering transferring to other majors, and some even start to detest the languages they are learning, because they feel that they haved paid a huge opportunity cost by learning something that can hardly earn them a living. While we treat language learning as a hobby, they are betting their future on a skill that&#39;s quickly becoming obsolete, a bet they feel they&#39;re bound to lose. This is probably the sad truth of our times.
How U say &#39;Dig it&#39; in yer lingo?
Imagine the electricity dies because of some solar flare or something and you relied solely on A.I. translations living in a foreign country
Anlamad<U+0131>m. Adam t<U+00FC>rk m<U+00FC> yok m<U+00FC>? <U+0130><U+015F>te skynet ne zaman bizi fethedecek ki?
Doesn&#39;t work for my Hindi.  I need a version that replicates my constant grammatical and gender errors my wife&#39;s family have come to know and love.
that was MANDARIN NOT CHINESE, MANDARIN IS NOT THE ONLY CHINESE LANGUAGE.
impossible if the language doesn&#39;t have a written script. Cantonese for example is a language which uses a foreign script (which is Written Chinese a.k.a Written Mandarin).<br>When a Cantonese speaker has to write and speak out loud Written Chinese with a Cantonese accent, it makes ZERO sense because the Written script is not ADAPTABLE to other Chinese languages.<br>And the thing is, there exists a Written Cantonese form, although it is seen as restricted to the lower class despite their being a history of people writing in Written Cantonese. This is why despite Cantonese having over 70+ million speakers, langauges like Irish have better technical support on Google Translate, Duolingo etc.
this doesn&#39;t work for languages that don&#39;t have a written script and basically gatekeeps while also encouraging people to learn a majority language
Thing is, learning a language enhances the person who learns it. AI is being used to automate humanity out of the picture. Everything that humans do is give them experiences and a new perspective on the universe(which is why we have AI in the first place). The lunatics who only care about $$$$ are pushing AI to destroy humanity and everything that made it possible to have what we have today. They think AI will make them gods but it is only making them devils. All it is doing is removing all the things that make humans amazing.
You honestly tricked me with this one I honestly thought you were fluent in Turkish and German I think the reason why many of us would be tricked is because we have preconceived ideas <U+0001F4A1> about certain groups of people and what they look like <U+0001F44D>
Amazing. Only thing is that in Turkish, we use present continuous conjugation for present context. We keep present tense conjugation for <U+201C>would<U+201D> meaning. This was the only thing the AI missed.
For Turkish, I think it&#39;s a pretty good translation and the mouth movements are in harmony with the sounds. Only some tenses and modals were unnatural.
I rather think AI will increase the number of speakers of an unpopular language, a language with very few speakers.
I think AI can facilitate genuine language learning by making comprehensive input more readily available. It could be sort of like &quot;training wheels&quot;.
I will keep watching your videos, because they are very good and educational
Amen
Turkish is  my Mother tongue. <U+0130>n my opinion it is gramer correct butnot the True way of speaking. Maybe for bussines it can work. I think cultuel notes are missing.
This website does translation for uploaded videos. There will be another problem with realtime translation with a wearable device: the word order. There are SOV, SVO languages and more variants. In some languages word order is strict. In conjugated languages it may be more flexible. Imagine translating from German to English: you have to wait for that verb show up at the end of the sentence. And there are languages that don<U+2019>t reveal gender like Turkish. AI may start making up he/she even it wasn<U+2019>t the original intent (this currently exists for even text but for simulatenous translation AI will have harder time to figure out the gender).
Will people be still necessary though?
The Turkish translation calques expressions in English- still understable and grammatical,but not very natural.
I think you nailed this topic. I agree with all you say. Nothing replaces watching news or even talking to strangers on the street in their own language while traveling.
yo no dejaria de aprender nomas porque la IA me lo hace de sin esfuerzo
Languages are doomed<br>We&#39;ll be able to communicate brain to brain sooner rather than later
Que Bueno Que Te Gusta Los Dem<U+00E1>s Idiomas a mi tambi<U+00E9>n me gustan los dem<U+00E1>s idiomas
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=43">0:43</a> Well I don&#39;t think a native Turkish speaker would say &quot;O T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>e konu<U+015F>maz&quot;, &quot;O T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>e konu<U+015F>may<U+0131> bilmiyor&quot; fits better here in my opinion
What I don<U+2019>t understand is people<U+2019>s belief that they understand what the impact of any new technology will be.  All this speculation about AI is just that - speculation.  The reality is that people will decide how to use AI and that will generate a lot of consequences, some intended, sort of, and a lot of unintended consequences.  Just think of the impact of computers on society.  Social media has had more and more profound impact on society than lap tops will ever have, and who predicted that?  No one.  Compare people<U+2019>s hand wringing over AI to the warnings about  Ragtime music, and I think you<U+2019>ll get the idea.  For the moment, personally, AI is an interesting tool that helps me correct my grammar and usage while I learn a second language.  That<U+2019>s about it.  It<U+2019>s no replacement for actually talking to other people in that language.
All these points about &quot;No, AI will not replace &lt;something&gt; because of &lt;something&gt;&quot; are just attempts to deny the reality. it WILL happen, the question is only how fast. It all depends on how convenient a particular technology will become to acquire the world-wide popularity.<br>A simple question: are you still sending real hand-written mails to anyone? maybe to see their eyes to light up? (that one mail you sent 10 years ago doesn&#39;t count)<br>P.S. I&#39;m telling it as a person who enjoyed learning a foreign language a lot years ago and benefited really a lot from it, both, personally and professionally.
Learning to paint in oil during the 1850ies. This is what it feels like, I guess. I learn languages as a hobby for the same reasons (not to the same extent or with the same deph), also a introvert I enjoy watching, listening and reading in my target languages. &quot;Alles wird nur halb so hei<U+00DF> gegessen, wie es gekocht wird.&quot;
Great video as always. <br>As a native speaker of German I can confirm that the translation was impeccable, no error whatsoever. Only the intonation, a little machine-like, could make us guess that it<U+2019>s a talking algorithm. <br>In what concerns the learning of foreign languages: I<U+2019>m completely with you. It might not be necessary for communication in the close future. But the pleasure of mastering different idioms has no equal (I speak/read/write 6 languages). It certainly, as you say, brings people closer to each other. <br>This text was written without help from an AI by a non-native speaker of the English language <U+0001F609>.
As a Turkish native speaker I can say that the translation was pretty good.
I think we should also keep in mind that some languages are just too different from each other that some sentences are simply intranslatable. So instant translating AI will never be 100% accurate. Also the tempo and word order differs from language to language, so these devices will never be 100% instantaneous either.
I think it will kill language learning. There is a small minority that learns a language for fun, but most people learn languages with a specific goal in mind, most often to use them in a professional setting. If that becomes obsolete, then you don&#39;t need to teach any foreign language at school, at university, or at language academies. There will be no need to do exams or certifications, so you don&#39;t need to strive for a specific goal or try to achieve a certain level. Even if people are going to keep learning foreign languages, this will be demoted to the level of &quot;fun facts&quot; to impress people at social gatherings, not actual fluency, because the motivation is just not going to be there.
Babelfish is coming! <U+0001F420>
As a quadrilingual person who knows English and Hindi, and can conduct a daily short conversation over necessities in French and German, the probable endangerment of languages upsets me.
Oh come on your german sounds fluent
I wish I could be this optimistic about this subject as you are... (sigh)
This is good news for fringe / obscure languages.  Regions can use and learn the native language and don&#39;t have to learn a nation or regionsl language, so these languages can grow.  (Wales can focus on teaching Welsh and not have to teach everyone English.)
Turkish; very minor mistakes.
Am learning hindi and i like connecting with the native speakers
No because you can&#39;t watch anime with AI.
Hey Paul! As a translator I<U+2019>m looking into switching my career path. Do you know if the developers of these tools are employing language professionals? Or is it reasonable to look for a completely different career?
is it worth learning a language you&#39;ll never use i&#39;m interested in Learning Lakotan but i doubt i&#39;ll speak to someone who knows it?
I<U+00B4>m studying Mandarin for 3 years now and I will not stop for all the reasons that you mentioned Paul. Thanks for the interesting video
i&#39;m often annoyed by YouTube&#39;s automatically translating video titles cuz it makes it harder for me to find videos in particular languages. and Google translate and Chat GPT have given be more materials in target languages, instead of making language learning irrelevant. same will happen with voice translation.
AI will always have problems with the slang and insults and drunk people calling the taxi company to get a ride home.  Don&#39;t forget that deaf people will need to communicate with their hands.  Also language learning is a good brain exercise in the morning.
The German was pretty good
As with many other skills, the process is what makes it enjoyable. Immediate results aren&#39;t satisfactory because there was no effort put into it
It definitely won<U+2019>t.  The question is, is this a real threat for interpreters?
So long as people choose to only do business personally, meeting face to face, AI has no chance of taking over the language business. As you said, learning a language for passive consumption (just reading or listening) is only half as difficult as learning a language for reading, listening, speaking, and writing. For &quot;dead&quot;/ancient/extinct languages like Biblical Hebrew or Sumerian, etc. the effort is only 1/4 as much, because you only learn to read it. AI will never take that away.
Turkish translation was flawless.
The predominance of English as made learning other languages less relevant. AI will just get us further down that path.
OMG man I was shocked when I heard Turkish fu*ck!
I think the fundamental problem is going to be the fact that these AIs are trained on basically &quot;perfect standard language&quot; or language which doesn&#39;t stray far from it, so I&#39;m not sure AIs will ever handle thick accents or &quot;broken&quot; language as well as a skilled human. They&#39;ll do an admirable job in the future (already are sometimes) on a given language&#39;s equivalent of Queen&#39;s English, but as soon as someone shows up speaking e.g. thick Scottish or &quot;boroken englesh bekos thei dont ar netiv spicker&quot;, the AI&#39;s probably either gonna start spouting gibberish or just give up.
<b><U+201E>K<U+00FC>nstliche Intelligenz<U+201C> macht man immer doofer.</b>
I think you&#39;re absolutely right. AI translation will be (and partly already is) used for things like business meetings. It just makes sense for companies to invest in AI technology once instead of hiring an interpreter or paying their workers more for their foreign language proficiency. But it won&#39;t be able to substitute the joy of language learning. As a Ukrainian living in the Flemish-speaking part of Belgium, I find it important to learn Flemish, as this way I am getting closer to understanding their culture. I just love these moments when I use a dialectal form or a proverb and their faces light up with a smile.
Hey Paul, Turks use present continuous tense a lot more than simple tense, even in formal writing. So it would be &quot;konu<U+015F>muyorum&quot; rather than &quot;konu<U+015F>mam.&quot; It is not wrong, it just doesn&#39;t sound natural.
Pretty good.
AI is created because society has no intelligence left in it
I&#39;m a native Turkish speaker and yes, that is more than enough for a formal job meeting. It isn&#39;t exactly natural or &quot;perfect Turkish&quot; of course, but considering you would need to learn Turkish for years just to be able to get to this level, it&#39;s an amazing tool. And it will only become better.
Nice summary.  It&#39;s interesting that you class yourself as a bit of an introvert, same as me. So I also have a bit of performance anxiety when attempting to speak another language with native speakers, and I get most of my enjoyment from reading in a foreign language, or watching videos, rather than speaking it.  But this is where AI will really be able to come into its own, ie as my never-tiring, non-critical language practice partner.  Thus I&#39;m eagerly looking forward to future improvements in the technology.  I do agree that any business-related reasons for learning a language will rapidly go down the gurgler, but this is no different to jobs in general in the long-term.

suddenly became a polyglut
I am from Austria and the german translation is very high quality however kind of too professional and robotic so it does not feel authentic. At this point I would not like videos in that style
Turkish translate is so good. I was focused your lips to understand do you really speaking turkish. But I aware with vowels. Those are fine but different from your voice.
When you switched to Turkish I was like: wtf dude!
Before watching the vid:  not for those of us who want to learn.
I would still casually study languages because I find them interesting, but since I don&#39;t speak any foreign languages fluently already, I won&#39;t put more effort into learning any in the future since it&#39;s too hard.
Language learning is like meditation it helps you stay in the moment
Could you cover the Dravidian language family at some point? Thanks!

It can never be instantaneous because word order is do different.  Gonna be a several second delay, but yeah, no doubt this will be widely used for &quot;real time&quot; communications very soon.
But every language related job is becoming vanished. Even the translation of achademic works. I even believe there will be devices that translate audio ilike you say something and then in says out loud the translation, very soom
AI, at this time, is not very good at idiomatic expressions. I had a video call with a friend in Brazil the other day and towards the end of the call we were talking about a location so far away that it was difficult to access. Out of nowhere, I said it was <U+201C>onde Judas perdeu as botas<U+201D>, which is a slang in Portuguese for somewhere so far away. The surprise look on her face and the laugher she gave was priceless. She said it was a good use of the idiom. That&#39;s the kind of thing AI can&#39;t figure out at this time. Still, I would like to implement AI more as a language learning tool.
I speak both turkish and german. And I am not gonna lie, I wouldve 100% believed you put in the effort and learned either one of those. It&#39;s really well done. And this is just AI being out in the public for a year now.
Damn! If AI can already do this then every job will be replaced by AI soon! What the hell are we going to do?
It<U+2019>s about to happen and prolly sooner than later. The days for a lot of Interpreters, translators and English teachers (native speakers and non-native speakers) are numbered . A.I. will disrupt their business. A.i. will put them out of commission <U+2026>.permanently.
&quot;Dein&quot; Deutsch ist perfekt! :)
Wow, as a German, I have to say this sounds SO AUTHENTIC. That&#39;s actually really scary. But I agree with the reasons you enumerated for continuing to learn different languages!
AI might create so many intercultural realities that people will have more and more incentivation to get to know a foreign culture and its language.
The key thing is that in many cases the translation itself make not much sense. Think about bible translations they are all not answering many questions. Perfect translations aren&#39;t available in principal.<br>Another think when you speak with someone in private, here AI mediator will not add a lot.
the german translation is very good and very comprehensible, but there was at least one grammatical error I noticed
If AI could diverse the people who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature and stear away from the very European and Western European languages (including a few Slavic language authors). That would be great. If great AI would be used at hospitals for communication about health care and procedures so that lots of immigrants would be getting better health care (this could be implemented in laws as well) that would be wonderful. But don&#39;t take away the fun in listening to music in other languages and understanding the lyrics.
Most work (officies, hospitals, content creation) will become automated, but close human contact (and work like refugee camps, kindergarten teachers, nursing) will not. It is a very different experience knowing that someone took the time to learn your specific language (and therefore probably also knows quite a bit about your culture).
Why would it?  I mean certainly not for those of us who study other languages out of curiosity.  I don&#39;t see how AI would reduce my curiosity.  Maybe it&#39;ll put translators and interpreters out of a job but not kill language learning.
I&#39;ve always been good at spelling and grammar, but any time I feel obsolete I can look at a few comments and be glad that I don&#39;t &quot;sound like&quot; an untutored idiot. I literally could care less about the exponential growth of functional literary ignorance.
In the years of watching your videos because they<U+2019>re so fascinating, I knew you were passionate about language, but this video showed the emotional part of your passion and added more of my appreciation for your work. Well done Paul!
I really appreciated your explanations near the end of this video, because this is one of the reasons I love learning languages: like using a time machine to communicate with people who lived in a far distant past and country, and I am feeling like a detective or archeologist deciphering very mysterious or old writings. I feel an extraordinary emotion and pride by doing that. As an introvert myself (but not particularily shy, I really enjoy speaking to people from time to time), I feel I can achieve a deep comprehension of a language and its culture or way of thinking that I could not grasp if I were using only AI. Besides, learning a language is very stimulating for brain and its development.
Great video, Paul! You always put great thought into your offerings. Yes, I think AI has usefulness in certain circumstances, but I<U+2019>d still rather learn a language on my own rather than relying on software; it<U+2019>s more engaging for the brain, I enjoy the learning process and, as you mentioned, the joy in communicating with someone in another language<U+2026> and being understood! <U+0001F606>
Shortly, you and us love languages, so, we can get AI aside!!!!
Excellent video. Now please do one on creative ways one can use AI to enhance the efficiency of learning foreign languages!
It made tl easy, but its still some years away, before you can skip learning and use ai tools. And then probably some devices like in The Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy appear, where you eat or somehow connect that thing and it will automatically tl speech to your language.
I think I will, yes. Although, whereas my motivation for learning French was a bit more of a practical one, learning Japanese has always been about understanding untranslated content, stuff that was never going to get localised. If AI means that I could have engaged with things without learning it, I think a younger me might not have seen the point in the exercise. Still, now I feel that the experience of reading the original Japanese couldn&#39;t be replaced by AI, the language is simply different enough with its own flavour that I wouldn&#39;t neccesarily want to just read a translation anyways. <br><br>As a job though, language interpretation and translation is somewhat doomed, and I lament that. I would have liked to maybe see how language skills could have turned into something of a career in the future. It&#39;s a real shame to me that it will not really be a viable option anymore, even if that&#39;s not what I do for work right now. The chance for instance, for me to get a transfer from work to another country because I have a language seems very reduced now, and that is a sad thing to consider.<br><br>Edit : One bonus to this might be the easing of the spread of English around the world. Maybe the number of people that are bilingual in their language and English will go down! The evil voice in my brain sees that as a good thing haha.
Woow, what IA can do is really incredible but it still needs to improve a bit. The Turkish I heard was almost flawless but some sentences sound obtrusive. Apparently, it is directly translating from English and that thing sometimes doesn&#39;t work.  For instance, when a native Turkish speaker hears a sentence like &#39; O, T<U+00FC>rk<U+00E7>e konu<U+015F>maz.&#39; what they will understand will not be &#39;He doesn&#39;t speak Turkish. &#39; rather what they will understand will be that &#39; He is insisting on not speaking Turkish.&#39; as in Turkish,  the Simple Present Tense is not used in that sense, it is not something he doesn&#39;t do but he cannot do. The use of grammatical structures are not always parallel in different languages, you know. A second thing is, style, I didn&#39;t hear a well-educated, gentle, language expert person with that &#39; fluent-in- Turkish Paul&#39; That persona sounded much like a everyday street guy, probably close to his thirties, unemployed and still living with parents and let alone being some  bookish, most probably has never turned the cover of a single book in his life. I think translation is not merely translating words or sentences, but IA will also be able to mimic the sentiments, personalities and souls of the source people very soon.
One of the most astonishing things where AI can make an enormous breakthrough, is the realm of writing, both literary and journalistic writing. Because AI can do those tasks, can create really good stories and reports, and, what is more incredible, AI can do that very, very well. It can be a tool for writers and journalists. By the way, what do you think about that Paul?
The German translation was believable and ok, but it started of in the middle of a sentence.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=317">5:17</a> You&#39;re wrong about that. AI is already capable in these areas. You need to keep up with the breakneck pace of AI improvements. <U+0001F923>
I think you&#39;re overestimating how real time these real time translations can get. In most cases the algorithm has to wait until the end of a sentence to produce an actual result and there&#39;s absolutely no way of getting around it. This delay between input and output is akin to a video with sound that is delayed in relation to the visuals by a few frames and we all know how awful is this to watch. <br><br>AI will level the playing field a little but knowing the language will always be an advantage in every case.
Of all the skills and professions that AI is said to threaten, I&#39;m absolutely confident that language translation is one of them. Language translation is one of the tasks that AI is extremely good at and would only get better at.
You might not get the opportunity to travel and speak to people when half the jobs are gone and you&#39;re fighting over what&#39;s left. It&#39;s very scary <U+0001F605>
Soo. Google translate got better!? It has been at your fingers for a long time now. It is old tech, not an AI overtake of the world. The imagery and voice are just non-AI functions. AI is a hype that will most probably crash in 2024.
I&#39;m intrigued by languages and polyglots have been fascinating me for a long time. Perhaps it&#39;s because I lack the talent to really learn and become good enough to use multiple languages, I don&#39;t know. Anyway, I agree that AI may in the not too distant future results in a &#39;global translator&#39; app to help people find their way in foreign lands, but it won&#39;t be good enough to completely replace the skill of being able to speak another language. Btw, ini saat yang sangat pas untuk mengikuti berita dari Indonesia karena sebentar lagi akan ada pemilihan presiden! <U+0001F602>
More AI real-time support will take a lot of pressure off. I&#39;ve always wanted languages to be just for fun to me. It will remove some of my panic as to which language to focus on because it would make it easier to consume content in languages I don&#39;t know yet. So, if language learning became more like knitting - fewer people making a living out of it, but a relaxing hobby for many - that would be fine by me.
As a native speaker of Mandarin Chinese, I think the translation is like 65/100. It works, but definitely sounds like a foreigner trying to speak Chinese.
I&#39;m a native speaker of german. I have to admit, that the AI is very good. Except the structure of the passive is a little bit different as in english. I would use it a little bit differently.<br>I grew up with many friends of turkish origin. I would say that I&#39;m quite use to the sound of turkish. It sounds a little bit chopy.
we don&#39;t say &quot;konu<U+015F>maz&quot; but &quot;konu<U+015F>muyor&quot;
I am a native Mandarin speaker living in China at the time I am writing this comment. I&#39;ll say that AI translation has a very standard pronunciation known as Putonghua in China, but the text is mediocre at most. I can get what it means, but nobody who speaks Chinese as their mother tongue will speak in that way, not even in formal situations. Just getting the grammar correct does not equal being native-like, or human-like. Is this due to a problem in lexicon?<br>Learning a language is often out of practical need or fun, but for some, language learning is a way to build their cultural identity that is different from the ones they were born into. This is especially true for immigrants, who are desperately seeking verification from non-immigrants about their adopted national identity. Speaking the dominant local language well is often seen as crucial evidence of &quot;assimilation&quot; of immigrants by non-immigrants. I know this is sort of unfair, but having adequate knowledge of the dominant local language does have a significant impact on a newcomer&#39;s civil liberty. <br>Another case is when there is severe discrimination and oppression, sometimes even outright persecution of minority groups based on non-cultural identities, such as being LGBTQ+ or disabled, foreign or second languages that carried information with progressive views are often seen as the key to freedom and justice. Learning these languages can be a way to liberation and may eventually lead to seeing this language as a part of the person&#39;s identity, even if they are never able to settle down in countries where the language is widely spoken.
Translations can never be perfect because some sentences can be interpreted in different ways and it&#39;s impossible for anyone except the original speaker to know the meaning.
This is shoching
I think at the end of the day is best to just turn yourself into an avatar in VR and live with everyone who come from anywhere in the world so you can just let the avatar speak for itself and you move it around to others, which is pretty much happening already in things like VRChat, so a lot of the AI stuff don&#39;t really need to happen in real life, real life will come to VR instead of AR.
I mean, you don&#39;t learn language to only speak in it on the internet voice. What about understanding everything that is said or written in it instantly? Or even using it in real life. I&#39;m against anyone who thinks that installing a chip in your brain is a possible solution! Those are too far gone.
Not learning a language won<U+2019>t help you develop your brain. Relying on AI will make people lazy and stupid
This was fascinating.  I honestly didn&#39;t know about that technology that can translate your own speech in video form.  One thing that might also be good (and bad if the info gets out and others can use it) is having a record of your voice and being able to type something and have your own voice read it out.  For example, for videos, there would be no &quot;multiple takes&quot;, and it would perfectly mimic the text in your voice.  Whatever the future of AI brings, I intend to keep studying Japanese.
I&#39;ve never been that good at learning languages. I&#39;ll get feedback that my pronunciation is good. But my comprehension is poor. I do use Google Translate to read song lyrics, and results are...odd. But for translations I can trust, I&#39;d want a translator.
merhaba karde<U+015F>im
I really do hope AI makes language barriers in reading and writing a thing of the past. Though I hope language learning can still thrive even with technology advances. I don<U+2019>t think AI can ever get to the point of fully understanding the nuances and creativity that can come from another language like humans can
I hope that AI keeps getting better at conversing with us as we learn the language. Imagine having an AI that&#39;s always there to help, explaining all the details, fixing pronunciation, and helping with grammar and vocabulary. It would make learning languages even more enjoyable and effective! And when you add to this the possibility of live conversation, we have the full package!
As I native Chinese speaker, I can understand the translation very well. Had I not known your voice, I would think you are a foreigner who&#39;s been living in China for a very long time. Though there are a few moments where the choice of word is a bit odd (not wrong, but no one speaks like that), I can definitely see how people may think this video is authentic.
there will be no need to learn languages in the near future
I learned Esperanto only because learning a language was something unattainable for me whole my life, but Esperanto just clicked, after that I was learning languages out of love for languages, their sound, look, grammar, culture.
YouTube polyglots beware!
AI Chinese is very bad, but German is fine. I speak both languages as a native.
Why every video about ai has to do this &quot;oh, all this was actually IA!&quot; thing?
Giving a completely different answer to the title of your video <U+201C>Will A.I. KILL Language Learning?<U+201D> AI could<U+2014>and should<U+2014>be used to <i>augment</i> language learning and is uniquely suited to do so because it can generate correct grammatical sentences <i>and</i> detect incorrect ones in target languages (and will only get better to the extent that it doesn<U+2019>t). So it<U+2019>s basically the language <U+201C>drill sergeant<U+201D> (<U+201C>drill<U+201D> in terms of instruction that is) with inexhaustible patience.<br><br>Designed properly, a language learning AI could guide you through the basics of a language in a way that no textbook or current language app can because its responses and next steps would be based on your individual responses<U+2014>it would be flexibly tailored to you. And, based on your mistakes (or simply at your request), it could go over some point that you didn<U+2019>t understand or allow you to practice some grammar point or construction with more (and more varied) examples. It wouldn<U+2019>t substitute for human tutors because there really is no substitute for human interaction<U+2014>I read with regret that one commenter feels that his or her job as a professional language tutor has been <U+201C>automated away<U+201D><U+2014>but it could make self-learning or the time between language lessons a lot more productive and fun because you could spend a lot less time figuring out <i>what</i> and <i>how</i> to learn and a lot more just <i>learning.</i>
AI translation will only work for me if I have it. What about the times I don&#39;t have it?
I speak German pretty well, the translation and lip-synch matching was very convincing to me
I guess I understand your point. I enjoy anime, and I watch it with Japanese voice actors, but English subtitles. Still, I&#39;m aware that there is a lot of nuance in the Japanese language that I&#39;m missing, and it has compelled me to learn some Japanese.
I study written Chinese, but I&#39;ve never used it functionally and have never had a sustained conversation in Chinese. I have read classic novels in English translation, like Dream of Red Mansions (Story of the Stone), but I get a thrill from reading a few pages of Cao Xueqin in the original. Maybe someday I&#39;ll be able to read a whole chapter in one sitting.
There is value in connecting with a culture in business. That includes learning the language, connecting with people and not leaning on a translation device.
For the German part, it sounds like a machine so far, odd choice of some words, the rhythm and melody of the sentence is off.<br>Basically sounds like all those scam ads you get on YouTube. &quot;Students found the perpetuum mobile and want to sell it on this hidden website you cannot find on google bit only on ads, as the energy companies would otherwise close it down.&quot; - Yeah, sure.<br>Well, maybe not as bad based on this small snippet. But it does feel off.<br>Might change soon if they get real multimodal models out into the world..
Can you do a video on your accent and dialect? It was very funny seeing people think you were not a native speaker of English lol
There is a problem with the structure of languages that seems to enable an accurate translation real time. It will not happen in the short term
First of all: my musical ear immediately picked up on a serious limitation of this software that I don&#39;t really see how it could overcome, and which would make real time translation impossible. <br>The software can&#39;t make your voice produce a sound that wasn&#39;t already in the audio you provided. The software is sampling your voice and then rearranging the sounds you made as appropriate. Thing is, sometimes a language needs a sound you didn&#39;t provide. The German section just doesn&#39;t work because you didn&#39;t say &quot;au&quot; or &quot;<U+00FC>&quot;. The first sound occurs in English, but is very rare and thus was not in the audio file you provided. The second sound just doesn&#39;t occur in English (not even allophonically, in the Standard dialect). Plus, it&#39;s also full of grammatical Anglicisms. The Mandarin Chinese only works because you&#39;re American. <U+01CF>t j<U+00FA>st s<U+00F2> h<U+00E1>pp<U+00E8>ns th<U+01CE>t <U+0100>m<U+00E9>r<U+01D0>c<U+00E0>n <U+00C9>ngl<U+00EC>sh c<U+00F3>nt<U+00E0>ins th<U+011B> s<U+00E0>me f<U+00ED>ve t<U+00F2>nes <U+0101>s M<U+00E1>nd<U+0101>r<U+00EC>n Ch<U+00ED>n<U+00E8>se (sorry for that mess Europeans). If you were British, it would not: British English is missing the crucial middle tone, it has high tone instead. Outside of East Asia, the only languages that have the correct five tones for Mandarin are American Standard English and the Scandinavian languages. And a Norwegian would still end up sounding like a comedy character because the tones would be ridiculously exaggerated. German has five tones, but they&#39;re the wrong ones. French has only three. Spanish and Italian have only two. The Turkish only works because English is one of the few languages that distinguishes &quot;ch&quot; and &quot;sh&quot;. If you started with French audio, it would fail: not only is &#39;ch&#39; the same as &#39;sh&#39; but there is also no glide. &quot;Tur<U+00E7><U+0131>ye&quot; would come out as &quot;Turshi<U+00E9>&quot;. I highly doubt a Turkish speaker would be amused or impressed, if indeed that isn&#39;t some sort of swearword. The AI is only deciding how to rearrange the sounds you made, it still cannot and probably never will be able to manufacture a sound that you did not actually provide to it. <br>AI will only ever be able to produce real time subtitles. Nor is the slight delay something which can ever be remedied. Think about how German verbs often come only at the end of the sentence: no matter how good the AI is, it will have to wait until the full sentence has been spoken before providing an accurate translation. It will not get any better than this in the future, sorry.
I&#39;m actually kind of frightened that we are entering a world where nothing that we do is necessary. Doing things only for enjoyment seems pointless to me.
Native Turkish and fluent German speaker here - The Turkish part sounded really unnatural, and not in the sense that it lacked the paralinguistic elements. It sounds as though it was translated word-by-word. German section was really robotic but no problems outside of that.
AI only makes sense under capitalism, if your goal is simply to be a more fufilled, happy human being replacing opportunities for personal development with artifical tools makes no sense
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=396">6:36</a> what happened to the cup there!?
Israeli me: man reality sucks, let&#39;s take a break from news and watch this Langfocus video<br>Israeli news on Langfocus: rockets fired on this and that ...<br><br>(tbh it&#39;s footage from 2 years ago but basically the prequel to our mess today lol)
The chip in the brain straight up Hitch-hiker&#39;s Guide to the Galaxy stuff, &quot;Babelfish&quot; (namesake of the old translation site) you inserted a fish in your ear for instant interpretation.<br><br>The Turkish here was mostly grammatically correct, albeit a little formal and textbook-ish. Fully understandable but sounds kinda unnatural.
If AI does every little thing for us in the future  life will be incredibly boring!
I almost believed you were speaking Turkish, I thought you could totally have learned that language. <br>For Mandarin and German, I noticed, especially for German because I <b>am</b> German and I can hear how you sound if you&#39;re actually speaking. For Mandarin, it was the sound of the tones that weren&#39;t <b>as</b> natural, but still incredibly good (learned Mandarin myself, the tones were very hard for me and I heard it a lot). <br>I, ofc, also have to acknowledge that it could have been more obvious because I knew.<br><br>I&#39;m currently learning Middle Egyptian (because I&#39;m studying archaeology) and also know (read/speak) Latin and Ancient Greek. For these two languages, we&#39;re pretty confident in how it sounded. But for Egyptian, we have barely an idea, because they didn&#39;t write their vowels, we only have the consonant skeleton.<br>I&#39;d be <b>fascinated</b> to see if AI would be able to better reconstruct the sounds for us by feeding it the reconstructed proto-language, the Coptic derivates, and sibling languages, combined with bi- or trilingual documents in e.g. Ptolemaic Greek or Assyrian. <br>I would love to know how AI could help us discover these things.
I have no doubt that ai also can help with learning languages. I was traveling in many countries that used to be a part of the USSR. I was at an intermediate stage at that point in time and google translate was really useful the times that i either did not understand a word or the times i did not know a word. Would not mind having some type of ai glasses or ai earpices yo translate when im struggeling
Haha ... but will it AI a Chinese appearance?
No, it will not.
Yes<br>Absolutely<br>100% <br>No question
Ai aren&#39;t good at dealing with slang.

German sounded really close to perfect!
Studied abroad at one of the two best universities in all of Asia for almost two years immersion (ONLY allowed to speak Chinese), and that Chinese translation made me whip around while doing chores. That takes years. I knew AI translation was already amazing, but I hadn&#39;t heard it with Mandarin until then. Jeese.
Not kill it but it will make it less and less useful, which actually it<U+2019>s not very useful today anyway.<br>Let me explain. Most people with good jobs or important positions in an enterprise or government, hire other people to do that very job that AI will do. In many countries, even with a good life standard, language learning is not seen necessary for most. Take Spain for an instance; despite living close to France, buying stuff from America, a country they love to say they hate but show how much they love, and being ruled by Germany since they are part of the EU, are always claiming for everything to be translated to Castilian, otherwise, they won<U+2019>t even look at it. <br>Only a handful of people get to make a living out of learning a language, most people do it for extreme necessity (e.i., are immigrants or have to deal in a daily basis with people who speak another language for business) or just for fun.<br>It might not kill it but it sure will take it to the brink of extinction.
The Chinese rendition is actually terrible. Phonetically speaking, the AI got every tone correct. But when put together, intonation is very rigid, and moreover, the translation itself is just not right.
Guys, tech isn&#39;t a god
Yeah, neologisms, colloquiallisms, names and surnames not accounted for in the AI database, and even things as simple as the context of the conversation may be a difficult for AI to understand. But the real question is: are we really supposed to be as relient on technology as we are, and even more in the future?
I&#39;d like to mention two additional points at this issue.<br><br>1) I think AI will never be able to understand context faithfully. For example, take the word &quot;spring&quot;. It may be a season name, a mechanical tool, a source of water or an uprising. So how do you translate &quot;Arab spring&quot;? Believe me, some dumb journalist certainly used a translation tool and got &quot;primavera <U+00E1>rabe&quot; (primavera = season) and now the ENTIRE BRAZILIAN PEOPLE says it this way!<br><br>2) (If you has read &quot;Dune&quot;, you will promptly understand this point.) The more you rely on machines to do your brain work, the more you&#39;ll be weak and dependent on them. To learn how to emit a vowel or consonant (or tone!) absent in your mother language is quite an exercise, a challenge that gives you joy when you finally manage to do it well.
i love how the entire society is experiencing essentially the modern art movement, we have to redefine what makes human human as technology is catching up
It would mean closing the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California.  That valuable real estate can then be turned over to Monterey and Pacific Grove for redevelopment.
Do you not think when real time langauge translation becomes practical, It will mean that English is no longer useful as a lingua franca? I know lots of young people nowadays globally are very keen to learn english, due to how widespread it is in mass media and the web, but maybe future generations won&#39;t bother trying to learn English sticking to their mother tongue
The german translation was way off! I think the sentence structure was confusing for the AI and so the grammar was not correct. Also the voice sounded quite robotic. It is not taking anybody<U+2019>s job yet <U+0001F605>
Reading the title. I&#39;d answer yes. It most probably will.<br>Map technology already killed navigation skills. With AI doing automatic translations, why would anyone do the effort of learning a new language. Unless you just actually love learning languages, and you&#39;re forever student, but it will make the NEED to learn impractical and unnecessary.
I&#39;m sad
Turkish is ugly <U+0001F602>
The thing with turkish is, no one speaks the perfect turkish like your K.I. literally no one. Even in formal situations the official turkish language isnt spoken like &quot;hochdeutsch&quot;. There are always some nuances which differs you from a native to a professional learner. Speaking perfectly turkish cant be learned, even if you are living 30 years in turkey. Thats a fact
A.I. can translate newspapers or bills of lading, maybe stereo instructions. However, translating Mother Goose, let alone FENAGAN&#39;S WAKE or the Odes of Pindar, is another thing. Real in-depth understanding will always require language learning. A.I. translation will still be profoundly useful.  It just can&#39;t  cover all possibilities.
You may also want to consider how some communities are really strict about learning their language. Most Europeans speak English but not all Europeans like to speak English with foreigners.
I think one place where language learning won&#39;t go away is probably in military intelligence, and it&#39;s for that reason you said; AI will probably struggle with the deeper nuances of language.<br><br>I&#39;m a 35P (cryptologic language analyst) in the US army that specializes in Korean, and I can tell you that if they were to try and replace our job with AI, it would be a disaster because AI relies on mass data consumption from across the Internet in order to produce, but what if the target is extremely &#39;shy&#39;, like the North Koreans are?  North Korea&#39;s Internet footprint is extremely small, so an AI couldn&#39;t do my job because there&#39;s too little data for them to use, and this is true for a lot of other enemies to the US, especially those in Africa and the Middle East, places that don&#39;t have as robust a connection to the Internet.
I&#39;m not real.
The first part of the German doesn&#39;t seemed completly correct, the second part is more or less correct but didn&#39;t sound as German native speaker. <br>However that flaws were not too big and one could get, what you or AI are trying to say.  In some years It will barely distinctable from real people like a news anchors.
Wherever two languages have different word orders, it is impossible to translate until enough is known about the input. And that makes it unsuitable for live translation.<br>As for the translated video: It &quot;synchronizes&quot; the lips and messes up everything else doing so. It is very obvious. The translation into German isn&#39;t bad, but I very obvious automatically translated.
I love my intermediate German for all the reasons Paul describes, and I was thrilled to recently spend a week in Berlin, and use it all the time, even things like taking the German tours in museums, not the English tour.  <br>I find that AI is super helpful for countless questions. I have in German, as shown in a random dialogue I had with AI this morning.  <br><a href="https://bqwebpage.blogspot.com/2023/12/chatgpt-tutors-intermediate-german.html?m=1">https://bqwebpage.blogspot.com/2023/12/chatgpt-tutors-intermediate-german.html?m=1</a>
Again, as in every affected area, not everyone will lose their job, just 90% of people involved will.
As a language enthusiast who also works in the realm of speech technologies, I feel AI shouldn<U+2019>t be a replacement but a COMPLEMENT of language learning. There will be novel teaching/learning methods thanks to the revolution of LLMs and they may clear many barriers in the learning of some difficult languages like Mandarin and Arabic, or even ancient languages. They can also be leveraged to preserve the endangered languages by encouraging more people to learn them with more intelligent/accessible/immersive approaches.
Am learning ai coding to make an ai that will learn and then find the most optimal way to teach me languages lol
&quot;Clown Planet. &quot; - Carl Vernon
Fun Fact: Everything &quot;AI generated&quot; is fake.  Everything.
Nothing the Carrington Event,  EMPs,  the Sun,  etc can&#39;t solve.
AI = Artificial Idiot
That is an excellent question.  And the answer is: I&#39;m not sure.
Yes, I will continue to learn languages.
Why not make neural link to learn languages faster or even download languages in your brain and wake up the next day knowing the language fluently
if you want to read the original if homers Iliad in its original rhyme and rhythm a.i. can&#39;t help you in any way. And even if you communicate with other people, a.i. won&#39;t help you much if you want to make a pun or &quot;wortspiel&quot; in the target language.
You reveiled another aspect. You&#39;re geekier than I thought. You&#39;ve got a gaming keyboard. Is that a Razorblade? You&#39;re into tech, aren&#39;t ya?
AI should be used as a complimentary tool, not as a human substitution to replace. Humans should be control such technology so they can use it to its full potential. Never rely on technology. Use critical sense.
As a non-native speaker of German, that does <b>sound</b> correct. But... obviously not native. And don&#39;t use it often.<br>So infrequently that I did have to rely on the subtitles to doublecheck. But it sounded good.
I think there will be circumstances where these new machine translation tools will come up short. Older computer games for example may not play well with on the fly text or speech translations. Also, for newer works, a human translator will be the first step of quality control for translations of prerecorded speech or prewritten text.
You are correct about human connection. I speak English and French. A few years ago, while I was in Costa Rica, I googled how to say, &#39; thank you for lunch&#39; in Spanish. At the time, I didn&#39;t speak any Spanish at all. I will always remember the delight on the restaurant owner&#39;s face when I said &#39;gracias por la comida&#39;. Today, I&#39;m learning Spanish. Learning a new language is a gateway to learning about another country&#39;s customs, history,  and culture. And opening up one&#39;s mind.
I can genuinely relate with Paul&#39;s language learning experience. As a non-native English speaker, I have never given English language the attention it deserves as the expression of a complex culture and history just because for me it&#39;s more of a &quot;functional&quot; language. It&#39;s a lingua franca and you often end up speaking it, but I may be somewhat more interested in other languages even if (or maybe because) you rarely get to speak it. Just as Paul, I learn them to understand news, books and online content rather than to speak them. For me, functionality is the least important driver of interest in a language. For the rest language learning is an exclusively human experience: it&#39;s the journey that matters, not the destination.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=410">6:50</a><br>Paul, you would love to play Chants of Senaar <U+0001F605>
As a German native speaker i think the German translation was pretty good. It was still just weird enough to notice it&#39;s probably AI generated, but i am still amazed what&#39;s possible!
I love watching the news in pig Latin
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=122">2:02</a>, the German translation is very good, and somewhat frightening knowing what is now possible!  Less than 15 years ago I used to make some extra money by translating technical German articles  to English, it was a tedious and time-consuming process.  Now the client could simply enter the text in Google Translate and it would be &gt;95% correct, even the grammar.  Am I wasting my time learning Russian.  Then again, knowing a foreign language and being able to converse fluently with native speakers while sitting around the dinner table, is something AI will never be able to replace.  Lots of people who met a foreign partner on an online dating site had an excellent connection, chatting for hours, but when they met in person, the relationship fell apart - conversing via a translation program is just too painful.
Learning a second language improved my life and help me fight depression that started with me after puberty in highschool. 20 years later my life is way better.
Even though ChatGPT style &quot;AI&quot; has been around for a while now, Google Translate has been around for far longer, and it is notoriously unreliable. <br><br>Maybe the new generative algorithims (which is what the current AI really is: computers aren&#39;t conscious just yet) are at least better than Google Translate, but I don&#39;t believe they will fully replace translators. At the very least, real translators would still be needed to correct mistakes in the Generative Language Model. <br><br>Even if documents can be &quot;translated&quot; by the algorithm, a human translator will still need to be paid to do a grammar and content check, because algorithms aren&#39;t great with context, emotional intent, or localisation. From an algorithm, You may only get a transliteration, which still has to be translated by a person. <br><br>As for the brain chips...it may be possible someday, but the current technology seems unsafe, given the reports about Neuralink&#39;s animal trials... <br>Even when that&#39;s fixed, I think many people would view it as an extreme privacy violation, and not use it. Ultimately though, whatever happens with AI, I think you&#39;re right that people will want to learn languages anyway, to make more friends, and understand different cultures and perspectives.
I don&#39;t believe that AI won&#39;t be able to speak idioms, slangs and local dialects. It already does it.
The added clips in foreign languages reminded me of me hanging around with friends and using all the languages we learnt <U+0001F605> just switching into one of them makes us happy, so as a hobby it stays for many years, but for work and other essential tasks, such as first help or excursions AI will substitute people<U+2019>s knowledge<U+0001F60A>
The German one was kinda weird
I think that AI will make language skills less functional and more recreational.  There will always be people who want to learn a language because it&#39;s fun and interesting.  A new language enables you to make new friends.  It adds a whole new dimension to travel abroad.  And how can you study a culture without studying the language that goes with it?  You might not need a second language for work but employers will always be impressed with the application and mental agility of a person, who has learned a foreign language.  People always warm to you, when you speak their language.<br>An increasing number of people are learning languages of their forebears.  AI will never replace the joy that comes of being part of a language revitalization movement.<br>I&#39;m getting old now and I learn new languages to exercise my brain, in order to stave off dementia.  There is no finer exercise for the brain than taking on a new language.  I&#39;m studying Sanskrit now.<br>And one wouldn&#39;t want to use an AI interpreter in the boudoir, would one?
Thanks for creating.
Language is too abstract to be fully grasped by Ai.
If we were only interested in functionality, we could just make everyone speak English. I&#39;d argue that insisting on doing things for reasons other than efficiency is one of the things that makes us humans.
Send this to the University of Aberdeen who are struggling to keep language degrees open
I<U+2019>m a language teacher and learner. I don<U+2019>t think AI will ever fully replace native speakers due to all the reasons you mentioned. Learning a language is also about learning the culture and connecting with people. AI can<U+2019>t do that. I also substitute my learning with AI and other sources (like YT and movies) but it doesn<U+2019>t replace having a teacher. FYI all my language teachers have been online
I learn languages and about languages because somehow I am caught by them, their sound, their structure. I never thought of them as a tool to make money. I think that AI can also be of great help for learning a new language. By the way, the German AI translation of your voice is perfect! I can<U+2019>t speak Turkish, but I paid attention to you and couldn<U+2019>t tell if it was you or not speaking it. I thought <U+201C>wow, he is also fluent in Turkish<U+201D>.
With Chinese being my L1, I say that the AI generated Chinese is incredible, despite the obvious foreign acceent. Not sure whether the accent is intentional or a result of imperfect program.
The short answer is no. We language lovers like me learn languages because we love the experience! To know new words, to know how to pronounce new sounds! It&#39;s a passion not about economy or industry. If someone has enough time and the passion will continue learning languages even if &quot;A.I&quot; acquire god tier intelligence. This &quot;A.I&quot; shit is pointless in many areas.
Awesome video, but I really missed &quot;Thank you for watching and have a nice day! &quot; at the end..
Honestly I<U+2019>m scared AI might replace everything at some point
AI is totally useless without electricity
So A.I. will help us with work; however, it will not be able to replace humanity. We will need to get more in touch with our emotions and understanding who we are so that we can become better people. Being authentic will matter more than being <U+201C>useful.<U+201D>Cool!
As a native speaker, the German one definitely sounds robotic but it&#39;s perfectly understandable. The problem is that it doesn&#39;t like a native but also not like someone who learned German later on, it really is in the uncanny valley for me.
As a native Chinese speaker, I think the translation is just perfect. If I didn&#39;t watch your previous videos, I would thought you learned Chinese secretly and had mastered it. Although the tone seems a little unnatural(not like human), but there&#39;s no mistakes I can find, and it&#39;s really impressive!
I&#39;ve noticed similar reactions to AI across other fields such as software and art (where those reactions can sure get more lively than with language learning). In all three fields people seem concerned about keeping their jobs as much as they are interested in the tech.<br><br>You&#39;re also not the only one who thinks AI will make human works more valuable, and I agree here. The rise of AI simply made me more motivated to create stuff (which seems to be the opposite of most people)
I learn languages fir tge same reason
Even if ai can translate in real-time with 100% accuracy, it still can&#39;t beat the experience of actually knowing a language.
NO...but it will make it all better.
Well, the German part sounds pretty convincing (although unnatural), Paul! The problem is, you can&#39;t compensate for illiteracy. AI isn&#39;t AI but machine learning, and I see that Google, Bing and Yandex translation tools are still messing up when the texts don&#39;t follow writing standards regarding syntax and orthography.<br><br>AI to me is just a &#39;buzzword&#39; and is far fetch from being good enough to replace humans in several activities. Machine learning (the right term from a programmer&#39;s standpoint) is full of biases which are inherited from the people who programmed and trained them.
I have been teaching languages for 15 years, and I will say that 99% of people learn languages because they need to. If there is no need, they will not learn. The ones who study languages for fun are so few that their amount is totally negligible.  So if this video is right there will be no language learning pretty soon.
I still refuse to use the back-up camera on a car.
Can AI speak colloquial Australian?<br>Not bloody likely, mate!
I see how AI language is an amazing tool if all of a sudden you need to communicate in Klingon or perhaps Elvish. I find that really cool. But not for personal interaction, language connects you with the culture. Perhaps that&#39;s why Esperanto never became an official language of anything. There is no people or culture behind it. I&#39;m sure that if they made Elvish a universal language, it will be far more popular. Albeit fictitious, the is an amazing culture and people behind the language. Besides, who wouldn&#39;t want to be an Elve?<U+0001F601><U+0001F609>
Contrasting your views on AIs effects on your personal wheelhouse to artist&#39;s views is interesting.
LOOOOOVE the dig at Elon Musk. That had me busting out laughing!
Good in theory I believe A.I would have a massive issue with many idioms, expressions, understanding tones of language ( no not tonal languages but tone of voice to express themselves) <br>Certain stress factors and the nuisances of any language that present itself.<br><br>Google Translate for instance only get about 55% of the entire message with multiple paragraphs which is complex difficult and hard to pose understanding.<br><br>Don&#39;t think A I will completely takeover language learning incredible less so languages themselves, too much pride on the line and many nowdays countries fought for those territories and language presided.
Well said,. AI will make many things obsolete but never human connection, nor our natural curiosity, nor our need for self expression. These are powerful motivators.
I believe it&#39;s not just about business or formal conversations but also culture. Think of multilingual countries for example, like Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, etc. where I personally believe people should have a decent understanding of the languages and cultures within their country&#39;s boundaries, as it&#39;s prominent to keep their national identities and keep them integrated. There are also dying languages that will become even more irrelevant if AI completely replaces language learning, as they most likely won&#39;t support them or would have really bad quality.
OMG this is horrible! There is software to mutate video to fake IRL people speaking not just English but other languages!?<br>I only can think of fake news corrupting news &amp; politics

German native here - The translation in my opinion works well, but I would, at this stage, not recommend using it outside of the business world. Let alone due to the countless nuances a language has, it is hard to exactly deliver the message you meant to with the tool, I could imagine. I think there is a reason why people can recognise automatically translated things and go &quot;Oh that sounds like google translate&quot; for example. Even though you could technically speak every language in the world with such an AI tool, it wont make you truly master it. There is so much more to it than just words. The country&#39;s culture, the social status of your conversation partner and so on. But it is still really impressive
One other benefit of language learning is that it&#39;s very stimulating for the brain,  and makes you more eloquent in your own tongue imo.  It just makes you a more interesting person.  There&#39;s some indication that it may make you less likely to develop dementia or Alzheimer&#39;s later in life, though the jury is still out on that
Native Chinese speaker here - The Chinese did not sound natural.
the thing is AI cannot understand context and there are homonyms that are very likely to be mistranslated
Will this mean that interpreting and translating jobs will be unnecessary?
AI already killing jobs for years. In my software company we use DeepL API translation for almost 4 years now to translate user interface texts of our apps. Before we had to hire professionial human translators.
A meme comes to my mind: a broom tells to a book &quot;Relax, buddy... They invented the vacuum cleaner, yet I&#39;m still here.&quot;
Paul, finding your video on Scandinavian languages lead me on a journey in learning about languages--also Jackson Crawford. With AI I&#39;ll still be interested in learning.
I completely agree, Paul! I think most of the people who like learning languages do it because of the reasons you mentioned, because we love how it feels to be able to understand this or that in the language(s) that we like. So, really hope that even if we have those incredible tools in the near future, people will keep interested in learning languages, because it&#39;s a great experience! <br>Also, we help our brains against alzheimer! <U+0001F609>
Try Polish, it may be fun :)
Only if AI can revive extinct languages or dying ones or massively make lesser-known languages more reachable for people.
Subtitles are annoying!  I much prefer to consume Russian content with them turned off.  That goes for the both Russian and English subtitles, whether translated by machine or human.
It&#39;s like saying we have calculators why need math? Same logic it appears to me so.
is it too invasive ask how many languages do you speak?
The Chinese translation sounded so bad that it gave me a headache, but it was understandable, and if it&#39;s already at this level now, I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll be nearly perfect within the next decade.
Hiiiii can you make a video about sign languages? Thabks
I&#39;m learning Chinese.  AI makes learning Chinese so much easier.  I can have conversations in Chinese about whatever I want, whenever I want, for as long as I want.  And nobody gets impatient or annoyed at my Chinese when it malfunctions.
I find AI very useful for learning some new vocabulary and reading customised short texts. Anyway, its always me who give it orders, and the brain remains mine
so how many languages does paul CURRENTLY  speak ?
I&#39;m brazilian and love very much German culture and language. And also Dutch. I studied them, read them, hear songs from pop into classical music in those languages.  AI will never change this love those languages, which are not really important to teacher tasks in Brazil,  in which most of sources are in Portuguese, Spanish, or English.
It<U+2019>s great for when you really need to get your point across with a language barrier but I haven<U+2019>t changed my DuoLingo goals yet
I was really interested to see and hear you using that software to speak languages. I would love to see more of this. For me I would like to see you try out Finnish.
I liked the fact that you did an opinion piece. I almost entirely agree - except for the neural link part. something like the knowledge of a language is too complex. at least going on from the technique we use today
I could definitely tell your Chinese seemed.... off. I can&#39;t put my finger on it, but some uncanny valley effect.
I had a very unpleasant experience last week. Someone who saw and knew I was learning many languages felt I was a nerd who had no life. I could imagine for this person, language learning is only a functional skill, something to impress people or put on a CV. What they can&#39;t see is what language actually is, how it can be a fascinating activity in its own right, how it is window into other cultures and hence the world outside of the English speaking one. Being an affront to the  dominance of English and English media and arrogance of its speakers is a good enough reason alone.
another excellent video. never disappoints.
For Turkish, yes it is pretty good. However, your tone is a little bit monotone and the stress is not correctly given. For grammer, there are some small problems because of the confusion between simple present tense and prensent continuous tense. We dont use simple present in some contexts, instead naturally we use present continuous although the meaning is simple present in english.<br>I am really impressed. It is one of the best idea after formal &quot;wearing&quot; tools in zoom meetings.
I&#39;m trying to learn Polish in order to help with my genealogy research.  The classes I&#39;ve tried seem to be focused on modern conversational language, but I just want to be able to read and understand old documents.  Since many of the 19th century documents I&#39;ve found are hand written in cursive Polish and German, even modern young people can no longer read them!  So I&#39;ve learned to read the old Polish and Fraktur German cursive scripts and have to transcribe the letters into Ascii text, then copy and paste into an online translating tool.  This is tedious, so I hope AI will get better at scanning and translating such texts.
The pronunciation of the German video was pretty good, but the sentence structure sounded unnatural so it was easy to tell that it was created by AI.<br>And what you said about the additional level of authenticity of genuine language learning is so true. There is such a deep and unconscious connection when you hear someone speaking in your native dialect and there is this great feeling of achievement when you managed to express yourself in a foreign language, even if not perfectly and I also like how you learn to see the world from many different angles.
I&#39;ve learnt Romanian to impress the girls and they are damn impressed! My feeling about it is great... will AI implant impress that much? nope.
I can&#39;t believe that neither Paul nor anyone else has used the expression &quot;Babel fish&quot; in this discussion!
Je suis enti<U+00E8>rement d accord.  De toutes fa<U+00E7>ons , c est le d<U+00E9>sir qui compte.

I&#39;ve been following futurist thinkers, technological progress, and contemplating the Singularity for nearly 30 years. It&#39;s surreal seeing mainstream society and other &#39;normies&#39; talking openly about something I&#39;ve kept in my private thoughts for most of my life. I&#39;m struggling to even describe the feeling. It&#39;s like a television show as big as Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad just came out, and the setting is my own neighborhood, the convenience store I go into all the time, the streets I walk down all the time. And the entire world is talking about it.<br><br>I mention it here because seeing it talked about on this channel is the biggest breakdown of separation of worlds I&#39;ve experienced yet. The news talking about it is almost normal. And teachers I work with complaining about ChatGPT and Google Translate has felt mostly normal.
The Turkish part was enough to counter the argument; it was unnatural the way words were arranged and pronouns were used.
AI will probably never be able to translate languages with few speakers. In Sweden we have at least 5 small indigenous languages spoken by up to a few thousand people. It will take like a thousand years for AI to collect enough information to be able to translate them and there is many languages lika that around the world.
AI will only get faster, cheaper and omnipresent. Also better, as users require. But one great ability of chatbots is to chat; AI will be the best language tutors possible; patient, attentive and able to track progress and add new vocabulary as needed.
It will enhance it. In this day if you aren&#39;t using GPT-4 (the paid version) for language learning you are doing it wrong.
I<U+2019>m currently learning Japanese, and no matter how frustrating it gets, I have never dreamed to have someone snap their fingers and instantly make me fluent in Japanese. Language learning is such a joy, and I would hate to lose the chance to experience it with the language I want to learn the most.
I prefer learning or speak  new language instead of using AI translation i desire to be multilingual <U+0001F642>
I probably overheard this, but the beginning of the German translation is a bit odd. There is no article, even though I&#39;d expect one (ein Video OR plural w/o article Videos), regardless of whether the translation is just supposed to seamlessly switch from Chinese over to German or not. But that&#39;s meckern auf hohem Niveau from an angehende Dolmetscherin ;)
Perfect AI translation is possible only if the AI fully understands the context. Otherwise it contains mistakes.
I want no chip nowhere close to my brain...
As a native Turkish speaker I can say the Turkish part was perfect. Not a single mistake or an offbeat sentence. Wow.
Perfection! Maybe best video so far. <U+0001F4AA> Keep it up!
AI will be mostly on the commercial applications of anything, as you mentioned. For the geeks, language will be always in our hearts for whatever reason. <U+2764>
yes lol<br>uncontrolled AI spread and humans relying solely on AI will destroy not only language learning, but all the civilization that we have built up until now.
I definitely will. I like the manual effort of putting focus into languages too. I don<U+2019>t like using never use <U+201C>smart<U+201D> devices like Siri or Alexa because I find talking to technology makes you mentally lazy, the more we become dependent on technology the less of our brain power is used. Technology is a good tool but it should NEVER be a replacement of your own abilities that you possess. I started learning languages basically by accident. I was experiencing intense social anxiety where I didn<U+2019>t want to go out in public and I didn<U+2019>t really have friends because of it. And I used languages to help me overcome social anxiety, it also taught me the power of giving. Before I learned languages I never saw the value of giving because I felt like I didn<U+2019>t have anything value to give. Learning languages is truly the ultimate act of giving, you give comfort to people since the people know you put your heart into Learning their culture and language<U+2764>
German: amazing
Recent studies have shown a correlation between dementia and polyglotism:  The more languages you know, the less likely you are to have dementia in old age.<br><br>The biggest &quot;drop&quot; is going from monolinguals to bilinguals.<br><br>And it makes sense:  humans are the &quot;conversing ape&quot;.  Language is quite fundamental to human brain function.<br><br>So, maybe AI translation will be a tool that people use <i>alongside</i> their Native and Second languages, with everyone learning a second language as part of good mental hygiene.
I&#39;ve always thought of this also in the sense of people having it easier to learn a language with AI.
No me gusta, para nada, el IA. Soy un hablante de irland<U+00E9>s trabajando muy duro para hablar el castellano.
It could happen that no one will release a software that automatically translates Esperanto because it&#39;s not used in business.
The most important comments I&#39;ve read so far coincide with those in my industry which is art and entertainment, the Problem with AI is that it might start to put in danger whole careers and employments. Works and employments that have been earned through academic preparation and degrees, it is not the automatization of manual labor, and low skill employments, we&#39;re talking about people who have dedicated their whole lives to linguistics, language learning, art and design, literature and writing. There is a reason Hollywood entered a huge strike recently, AI might put in danger and make unstable some of the most sought after and beloved careers we have.
It&#39;s both frightening that this thing might take over my job one day but also you could enjoy movies dubbed in Polish without that obnoxious lektor buzzing around in the future. I guess you win some you lose some.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=127">2:07</a> The German wasn&#39;t <i>bad,</i> but it was, well, flat.  It missed some of the nuances present in the English script you showed as subtitles.<br><br>Side note: AI is gonna have a problem with German, unless it&#39;s acceptable for it to always sound like a talking textbook from 3 decades ago.  Spoken German over the past century has been a rather dynamic, &quot;fast&quot; changing language.  German youth are notoriously innovative in their slang, a slang that becomes standard colloquial once they all turn 30!  Then the next generation vibes along and changes things <i>more!</i><br><br>I wouldn&#39;t be at all surprised it&#39;s late 21st-Century German teens took AI translation as a challenge to come up with really wild <U+201E>Jugendsprache<U+201C> to vex as many oldies as possible! <U+0001F601><U+0001F609>
You&#39;re a man after my own heart, Paul, and you have a nose after my own nose (Celtic). AI can&#39;t rob us of that! Practicality has never driven my passion for languages. The only language I&#39;ve ever learned of necessity is Arabic for the Navy (I was a translator), and I hated it and was terrible at it the whole ten years of my professional involvement with it. It wasn&#39;t until years later, after regaining my faith in Jesus Christ, that my heart toward it changed. I had deliberately forgotten most of my Arabic, and one day I came to my senses. &#39;What am I doing? I&#39;m an idiot to want to lose this gift!&#39; So I began praying to God for help with relearning the language and reading the Bible in Arabic. I had never prayed for help with it before! The change was immediate and astonishing. Before long I was far better than I had ever been before, and instead of antipathy I now had a new and enthusiastic love for the Arabic language - and the Bible! Years later, my fire is still burning ardently.<br><br>I share all this because you mentioned loving Biblical Greek and Hebrew, which I am also learning and love. In fact, I&#39;m going to be studying them this coming year at university as part of my theology major. Admittedly, that&#39;s the part I&#39;m most excited about. <U+0001F60A> So now my question is, are you a Christian too?<br><br>Thanks if you read all this. God bless you!
Paul, your office is all fancy now. ... German translation is good enough but with no regionalism at all ... remember everyone, AI is just a computer. THey&#39;re fooling you into buying more products by scaring you with personal computers, which are 40 years old. What we should be afraid of is laziness, selfishness and entitlement, which is all that AI technology and Silicon Valley has to sell
Totally agree language is the most human thing
1000% agreed with all points aside from wearable technology cause that sounds very far-fetched.
As a German native, the translation was perfectly understandable, but appeared somewhat unnatural in a few places and the pronunciation felt slightly off, too robotic
You would like to watch a scene from a sci-fi TVshow called &quot;Star Trek Discovery universal translator malfunction.&quot;<br>The &quot;Universal Translator&quot; is a never well-explained and never-consistently used device that somehow makes people who talk vastly different languages to understand each other. More details in Memory Alpha (the Wiki of Star Trek) and multiple videos.<br>The first and only time so far a malfunction of the Universal Translator has been portrayed was in that scene - and the person who saved the day was the only officer who had made the effort to learn languages.<br>Enjoy!
Currently, English seems to be the de-facto international language. Do you think AI will decrease the amount of people actually fluent in English, as English learners rely more on AI to translate conversations for them?
As speaker of Chinese and German, I would say that the AI generated speech is already good enough to deliver formal idea.
I am learning chinese.
Hello Paul, you are addressing an extremely relevant topic here.<br><br>Foreign languages are already hardly a part of the curriculum for most English-speaking countries. AI translations will simply help people berate/belittle and insult language geeks by saying &quot;why are you wasting time on learning French when you could be learning some much more useful STEM subject?&quot;<br>Non English speaking countries that are fighting to balance their budget, could be striking foreign languages entirely to save money spent on education.<br><br>That said, it will certainly be useful to be able to find a doctor and describe one&#39;s symptons when visiting any country, no matter the language. <br><br>The greatest challenge I see for AI is learning to deal with shades of meaning, synonims and language registers (including  the speech levels typical of Asian languages.
I am Azerbaijani, and Turkish and Azerbaijani are very similar languages, so I can speak and understand Turkish perfectly.I think AI translated your speech perfectly.<br>Paul, can you please make a video about Azerbaijani?
I am currently learning Hawaiian in my free time. There&#39;s no way an AI, at least for now and probably for a long time, would be able to make a speech sound as natural as a native speaker could make. ChatGPT and Google Translate both create some weird sentences as well, this all happens due to the fact that Hawaiian content is meager, it is hard to find good content. For languages like Hawaiian, Okinawan, Greenlandic, Basque, etc. it would need more work, or maybe they won&#39;t even have any type of person working on them, because the population of these languages is small anyway. Moreover, languages are always evolving in every place. Some people might use some expressions more locally and come up with new expressions, as a result, an AI would need to follow this evolution.
Wow, der deutsche Teil h<U+00F6>rt sich unfassbar echt an.
You should be more clear which dialect you mean when you say <U+201C>Chinese<U+201D>. I don<U+2019>t think it<U+2019>s wise to marginalize other dialects.
I already speak a few languages why stop now
I<U+2019>m a professional translator, and, aside from short phrases or sentences, automated translation (like Googe Translate) pretty much always require human revision. So I think, at least for a certain period of time, human intervention is necessary to have the most accurate translation.
I use AI a lot, yet I continue to learn French (slowly). As well as enjoyment, I&#39;m getting older and I&#39;m well aware I need to keep my brain active - use it or lose it. Having an AI do everything for me won&#39;t help me maintain my mental faculties. I don&#39;t speak French with anyone just yet, but come retirement I&#39;ll go and give some French people something to laugh at for sure!
I&#39;m a language teacher and I&#39;ve noticed that when the students who love the language they&#39;re studying are the ones who really get ahead and they always prefer classes in person. I believe (human) teachers make the learning process very personal and, as a result more meaningful, enjoyable and memorable. Ah, and those students usually hate online lessons <U+0001F605>. I haven&#39;t found until this day one student who liked online classes let alone learning with A.I. Probably those who need to learn a language for work are more ok with that.
I&#39;ve been using ChatGPT for &#39;texting&#39; in Japanese. It&#39;s X times more effecient than Hello Talk. Responds right away and 99% accurate - not too mention, you can customize GPTs however you want. Mine provides a clear explanation, correction, and response to my prompts.
An AI application can only be as good as the data. Would the training data include EVERYTHING you would enjoy? Probably not, unless it&#39;s a personalized set of data that you can confirm the completeness. So the wholesale LLMs wouldn&#39;t and couldn&#39;t replace 100% of language use. The risk is when those LLMs make, say, 99% of language use 99% cheaper, the remaining 1% use wouldn&#39;t justify the much higher resource to invest and improve. It&#39;s like when cheap frozen chicken meat is vastly available then the majority would just take the deal and forget about raising their own chicken. Of course there will be people would know the savory taste of freshly prepared chicken meat and create its demand and market. But for those who are born in a world of LLMs, the 1% use would become niche that people would find difficult even remembering existed.
AI will never eliminate the need to learn Upper Pelonian, which no one currently speaks but Pelonians, and translate the Bible into it. (Almonian (or Elmonian) and Pelonian are placeholder language/ethnicity names.)
As a native Turkish speaker, even though there were some minor mistakes in the translation, it was pretty good. And I am pretty surprised by it.
I somewhat disagree, AI will make easier to learn languages too, let&#39;s not forget that learning languages is difficult because of the current system that doesn&#39;t want to move on from the way things were done in the past (your classical text book in your school class), when we finally move on from that into comprehensive input as a standard, and AI helps us to enhance it (which will also have it&#39;s cost, it&#39;s not easy), the act of learning a language will be enhanced too. You have to look at demographics as well. Learning languages is good for who? For the average middle/middle upper class  European/North American developed country person? Yes, it has its benefits, but this is more important for the migrants who want to change their lifestyle, if they want to be assimilated, the country itself will put the money needed to make the integration much faster, and that includes language too, it will be like that for various decades, since it&#39;s unlikely that countries like Germany, France, or Nordic ones are gonna be okey with just English for everything, you have to adjust to the country&#39;s customs, and that includes language. Yes, I think language learning will change, many activities will now be possible to be made with AI, and that&#39;s awesome, but the usefulness of a language goes beyond a job these days. And the demographics just show, that, if developed countries want to survive, and they are not having children at the rate they need to do so...they are gonna need to integrate the people from outside. That&#39;s gonna carry a lot more than just language, but as you can probably tell, language is gonna be important, don&#39;t let anyone fool you, big changes take time, give it up from 20 to 30 years before thinking that we could truly discard learning a new language, and that&#39;s still a longshot, considering the demographic crisis in the developed world. Making language learning easier with AI will enhance the quantity and quality of qualified people entering the job markets of those countries.<br><br>Also: as an added bonus, for me, the coolest stuff we&#39;ll get due to AI, is finally, a new standard for dubbing and subtitling for dubbed content. I wanna learn a language with the content I love, not just the content I have available in it&#39;s origin form. I wanna learn German with a Japanese show dubbed in German, but the dub itself doesn&#39;t have a subtitle with the idioms of the German dub...that&#39;s a big bother! And the same goes for other dubs like Arabic! But that&#39;s for the future! Damn I envy my children already, they are gonna have it much easier! <U+0001F605> Just imagine the automatic translations, explanations of the grammar and context, and natural audio with emotion, all in one from even picking a physical book with those interesting looking glasses (I want a model with the design of X-Men&#39;s cyclops please! <U+0001F60E>), it will be easier guys! We are assuming things will disappear from having a practical use, but technology makes things easier to work around too, it&#39;s a new and interesting era, and just like anyone else, if you are worried about your labour stability, we better get upgraded with the new tech, and think of the ways in which we can use it to enhance our productivity. I&#39;m already thinking of all the content I will be able to enjoy because of AI, can you imagine merging Lingopie with AI? As a tech and language enthusiast, I&#39;m extremely happy, many boring tasks will disappear, and I will be able to express my love for cultures and exchange much easier to my children because of AI too!
I think learning new language than what you already know is a talent. And whether or not AI is going to make it useless, if a person is optimistic about learning language, they will not derail themself from their track. <br>For me, it&#39;s always gonna be a no. No, I never gonna leave learning a language. Even when I&#39;ll be busy with my works. The little happiness after learning a language is very big for me. And also after learning a language and observing it I&#39;m trying to make my own language and that&#39;s all I want. Different languages have different type of grammer, sounds, alphabets and that&#39;s also one of my favorite thing. I&#39;m learning it anyway despite the fact that it will not gonna help me in anyway in my life or atleast in the next 10 year. And those who&#39;re upset about it, just one thing to say - we do many thing in our life which is useless and many times we regret it but in this case np matter how useless this process is. This is definitely not regretful....
For anyone who actually enjoys the feeling of accomplishing learning a new language, loves to see the progress of those neurons connecting in their brain and watching as nonesense sounds slowly become distinguishable speech, no. The idea that AI will kill said desire is a joke, I&#39;d be much more worried if I were an artist or actor, not to say AI is going to take those professions away any time soon or the joy of learning to draw or act for that matter.
I still dislike AI for many reasons. Faster/more efficient isn<U+2019>t always better. We<U+2019>re going to lose touch with much of our own humanity. Even speaking the language in business settings (translating basic Spanish and Chinese to my foreign coworkers) is a special human thing. <br><br>We keep pushing for things to get better without looking at how it can makes things worse. I think a lot of this has to do with how depressed the recent couple generations are. <br><br>Maybe I<U+2019>m just a whiny grandpa.
So Star Trek!
Excluding my native language, English, I study a little bit of four languages and a not very little bit of one and if there was no functional reason to learn a language I&#39;d definitely stop studying ASL and Spanish but I&#39;d still study Tongva, French, and especially Dutch. I already only do because I want to, and Tongva is an extinct language anyway. The AI can&#39;t have any effect on my desire to learn those. Plus, I imagine it will be quite a while before AI can completely take away any functional reason to learn a language. Don&#39;t know, though.
Glasses might be Geeky, but they&#39;re also a medical device. I swear nobody stigmatizes wheelchairs and hearing aids like that. What&#39;s the difference?
I&#39;m not a native speaker of any of those languages, but I could hear a machine twang in all of them. It was more of a giveaway than different lip movements.
Paul, when someone addresses you in English, do you get impressed? shocked? fascinated?...Well, I&#39;ve been learning Dutch for a while, and even though I have no one (literally no one) to talk to in that language, I&#39;m learning it because I find it riveting, especially the grammar and the phonology. Ik ga je dezelfde vraag stellen: vind jij het leuk als iemand in engels met je praat?

As a Turkish speaker, I am impressed that the quality of the speech is very good although it uses a tense we normally never use during a conversation. &quot;Konu<U+015F>maz&quot; is in simple present tense, and we usually tend to use present continuous tense.
German speaker here: That was pretty passable <U+0001F62E><br>Sure, there were some robot-ish qualities which made it clear it&#39;s fake, but the timbre of your voice sounded believable enough o.O
Good point about language learning for enjoyment sticking around. There are lots of anime with plenty good English dubs, but I choose Japanese because I like it.
Will AI kill it? Absolutely not, and, IMO, you mention the most salient aspects as to why it will no happen. Interestingly enough, it may lead to a decrease in the knowledge of the lingua franca of the moment, currently of course English, as it usually is not a passion project - just something you get through exposure and because of necessity. <br><br>As a professional simultaneous interpreter, I expect my field to disappear at one point or another but really not in the near future. The tech still simply isn&#39;t good enough. There are particularly two things that I see as major obstacles for AI to take over the field: <br><br>Firstly, speech isn&#39;t perfect. People e.g. mispronounce a lot and often leave things unsaid (and the listener corrects and fills in) or just take a sudden turn in the middle of a sentence. Additionally, in some languages, speakers never seem to put a full stop in their speech at all, which absolutely does not comply with the rules of other languages. Add to that i.a. all the regional varieties and the differences between spoken and written language, and I myself find it fairly hard to imagine that AI will soon get up to a sufficient level where it can cope with everything I have mentioned. <br><br>Secondly, and maybe more importantly, the extra-linguistic features of the speakers. The same words of a sentence can be interpreted differently just on the basis of what the speakers emphasise or their tone as well as of their gestures and demeanour. To be able to cope with this, we really are going to need something much more than an AI that is more or less a mere translation/interpreting device. It has to be a true intelligence.
Reading the comments and thinking about Paul&#39;s answers, but especially being a grammar teacher and a specialist in languages native to the Americas (that&#39;s such a long sentence that I would like to see AI translate that... AND WE&#39;RE NOT DONE YET! <U+0001F602>), I think a few things are overlooked:<br>1) there are roughly 7000 living languages on this planet. Sure, AI will tackle English , Chinese, French, Turkish and other big ones... But that&#39;s ONLY because of the human input from speakers of those languages. Believe me, nobody will bother to  &quot;teach&quot; AI small indigenous languages like Warao from Ecuador, Palikur of French Guyana or.. Halkomelem, the native language of the place where Paul is from (if I&#39;m correct). Let alone the different dialects of these languages.<br>2) speaking of dialects, accents, variants, etc... A German speaker and Turkish speaker already mentioned this... What AI &quot;speaks&quot; is an extreme form of a standardised language. Otherwise said, it&#39;s not speaking at all... It like a chess computer. They don&#39;t play chess, they calculate incredibly well. Chess however is so much more (playing with ones nerves for example)<br>3) brings me to the last point. There is a difference between speaking a language and (re)producing it. Speaking is with emotions, feelings, etc... I doubt AI will be able to reproduce these: so far it&#39;s all human imput...
Wow. You are WAY too optimistic. I don&#39;t doubt that AR headsets will eventually be able to translate things in real time. But I think you&#39;re forgetting that most people can&#39;t afford this luxury. Wearable tech and brainchips cost thousands of dollars. Duolingo is free.
Paul,<br>You forgot to mention another reason why some folks learn foreign languages: Keeping your brain active. It becomes more important as you get older. I wouldn<U+2019>t call myself old yet, but I have been learning French for the last 2 years exactly for that.
I&#39;m a German teacher, and the German was spot on. No mistakes
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=470">7:50</a> yes because languages will lose a lot of meaning a lot even by an accurate translation.<br>Also, til now translations also make plenty of mistakes.<br>For example, my other comment about the Turkish speech.<br>The AI doesn&#39;t understand the interpretation of for <U+201C>for example<U+201D> He just translates like a bot.
German was perfect
AI is already making language learning better (for those of us who are interested in it).

I would never in my enitre life trade the fun experience that is learning a new language that I&#39;m really interested in, no matter how hard the language in question is to learn or whether will I ever really need skills of that language in my life later, and all the funny mistakes, all the fun discoveries you make along that way.<br><br>Not to mention all the brain candy you get while learning a language, the shocked and confused faces of your relatives, your friends seeing you speak a language they don&#39;t understand, and the surprised and/or joyful faces of native speakers, not expecting you to communicate with them like a local, may your attempts at that be flawless like of a native speaker or a little bit silly.
AI cannot replace learning local cultures and conventions. And as you point out, face-to-face interactions are another order of activity than videos. I&#39;m glad you also mentioned ancient languages! AI cannot get into ancient languages and cultures with all their unknowns and ambiguities. Only a human mind can grapple with those.
Native Turkish speaker and translator here. While the translation wasn&#39;t bad and it got the point across, there were a couple errors that make it obvious this is a machine translation, and the voice sounds a bit robotic as well. But depending on the &quot;quality&quot; expected by the client, it could be good enough. Given time, most companies could use a tool like this for most translations.
The German created by the AI tool sounded a little bit electronic but the grammar was good.
English speaker learning Spanish and French.Learning other languages is more than just word substitution because learning other languages is also learning different ways of thinking.
I doubt AI will completely replace human translation, particularly for dead languages. I once tried to converse with ChatGPT in Anglo-Saxon and it was atrocious. ChatGPT invented words and endings. Every sentence had numerous mistakes. I later tried it with Latin and it was better, but even then it still made up words.
AI definitely make me forgot my Turkish bruhh
Thank you, Paul. I totally agree with you.<br><br>I&#39;m learning Welsh currently. People often say it&#39;s &quot;useless&quot; because almost all Welsh native speakers can speak perfect English (or Spanish, if they are in Patagonia). But I still want to learn. I&#39;m living in Wales. I love Welsh culture and history. I see the Welsh people fighting for the destiny of the language. I want to respect their efforts. I want to talk to them in their native tongue rather than in English. <br><br>Even if nobody speaks a language, so what? It&#39;s just people&#39;s nerdy hobby. Learning a language makes me happy and makes many people happy. Does Klingon have many speakers? But it&#39;s very important to Star Trek fans. <br><br>By the way, the invention of bikes, cars and trains makes running much less functional. But many people still love running.
Excellent video.  Focus on human connection is key.  That&#39;s what makes my love for language learning tick.  Something your video prompted me to ask myself, can AI be used to preserve language diversity and/or to document moribund languages?
Even if greedy corporations will probably use robots to make work harder to obtain and / or sustain, I think artificial intelligence will stimulate a new wave of desire for the HUMAN element of interaction and consumption. I learn Arabic, for example, out of a desire for spiritual advancement - and that&#39;s something a robot cannot have: a soul. Furthermore, I learn Hindi / Urdu (collectively Hindustani) to be versed in the language of my ancestors and my folks back home in Bihar, India.
Why do people still draw and paint when they can just as easily take a photograph? Why do people continue to read and write books when we have TV and movies? There&#39;s so much more to the experience of language learning that the practical application. For a lot of us the journey is its own reward.
Now I&#39;m 100% sure you are an AI. It doesn&#39;t make you less awesome though
It is without a doubt that AI will eventually be so adept at translation to the point where every human translator gets replaced by an AI one.<br><br>Nevertheless, translation is inherently an imperfect process, wherein the transfer of information from one language to another seldom occurs without alterations. A striking illustration of this phenomenon is the challenge posed by definite articles, such as English&#39;s &quot;the&quot;, Arabic&#39;s &quot;al&quot;, and Portuguese&#39;s &quot;o&quot;. When translated into languages lacking definite articles, such as Chinese, Russian, or Turkish, these linguistic nuances often become obscured or omitted.<br>	<br>Another example lies in languages with perfect tenses. Consider the phrase &quot;will have eaten&quot; in English, which can be relatively straightforward to translate into Spanish due to the existence of future perfect tenses in both languages. However, this ease of translation becomes less apparent when dealing with languages like Tagalog, which lacks an equivalent future perfect tense. In such cases, conveying the precise temporal nuances inherent in the English expression becomes a more intricate task, requiring careful consideration of alternative linguistic structures and expressions in the target language. This highlights the unique challenges posed by specific linguistic features that may not have direct counterparts across diverse language systems.<br><br>Korean honorifics present yet another challenge in translation. These linguistic conventions, deeply embedded in the fabric of Korean communication, carry subtle nuances of respect and formality that may not have direct equivalents in other languages such as English. As a result, the intricacies of honorifics may be lost or inadequately conveyed during the translation process.<br><br>Furthermore, humor, particularly in the form of jokes, constitutes a fascinating dimension of linguistic expression. It is a well-established observation that jokes often lose their intended humor and cultural resonance when translated. The play on words, cultural references, and linguistic nuances that make a joke amusing in one language may not seamlessly transition to another language, leading to a loss of comedic impact.<br><br>The points mentioned above are but a few examples that underscore the inherent complexities and limitations in translation processes, ranging from the nuances of definite articles to the challenges posed by perfect tenses, honorifics, and the delicate art of humor. These intricacies highlight that, to fully grasp the richness of a culture, relying solely on translation may not be the most effective approach. Instead, a more comprehensive understanding emerges through direct language acquisition. Learning the language yourself not only enhances your ability to navigate linguistic subtleties but also provides invaluable insights into the cultural nuances that shape communication. Therefore, while AI continues to advance in translation capabilities, the depth of cultural understanding achieved through language learning remains unparalleled.<br><br>PS: Yes, this was written with the help of ChatGPT.<br><a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/aacb3b7a-a002-4c9f-bd7b-aef7142b8fd2">https://chat.openai.com/share/aacb3b7a-a002-4c9f-bd7b-aef7142b8fd2</a>
un-Babeling<br>Also, would be interesting to try out on hungarian <U+0001F923>
As a native speaker of German, that sounded really close to how people would speak! A bit off, but very close!
Paul you&#39;re seriously one of my favourite YouTubers ever. I look nowhere else when I want some info on any language. Amazing job as always
Languages are amazing and A.I. could never cover every subtle detail there&#39;s in a language neither how exciting it is to dicover , learn and assimilate them. It&#39;s a personal experience.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=95">1:35</a> I<U+2019>m a native Mandarin speaker. The AI-translated speech is generally fine, but it is still different from what a native speaker would say, and just gives out a foreign vibe, like Apple commercials in China.<br>Also, the pronunciation is a bit weird regarding its rhythm and tones, but I think that<U+2019>s a general problem for text-to-speech systems.
I was shocked to learn just yesterday that a Dutch man I&#39;d thought bilingual in English really isn&#39;t!  I wrote to ask him a question and he answered that he couldn&#39;t answer because his translator app couldn&#39;t handle my wording!
I mean, the German part was understandable. But if you said &quot;Or if I want to create a video that goes viral in Germany and Austria&quot; ... This is not exactly what the AI said. It should have said &quot;Oder wenn ich ein video erstellen will, dass in Deutschland und <U+00D6>sterreich viral geht (oder gehen wird) kann ich es in Deutsch <U+00FC>bersetzen.&quot; It kind of cut off the part &quot;Or if I want&quot;. I mean, you can still kind of get, what is being said, but the first sentence is not complete.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=444">7:24</a> very very true, literally me! I love the experience of acquiring new information from another language. Btw, you watch Indonesian news? Woah I&#39;m shocked that you&#39;re updated with our situation right now, the president election for 2024.
AI cannot solve the fundamental problem of translation (intranslatibility), because it is unsolvable. Translation is an art, not a science. AI will not make language learning obsolete ; in the same way that even when books are available in translation, you will always find people willing to learn a language in order to enjoy them in their original version.
I think you&#39;re right Paul, but the language learning market will shrink dramatically and that&#39;s bad news for teachers.
At most learning another language will be a simply a matter of personal pride and development, but even that will be a long time in the future, AIs that can reliably interpret one language to another don<U+2019>t exist yet and it will be a long time before they are common enough to make learning new languages and cultures impractical.
Thank you for this, Paul!  I&#39;m a bit of a language geek myself, and you have always inspired me.  Even though you&#39;re an admitted introvert, if I were to ever run into you at a polyglot event, I would introduce myself and thank you personally.  Best of wishes for more language adventures!
French??? Aren&#39;t you Canadian?
there always will be immigrants who need to learn local languages. there will be people who want to learn globally used languages such as English since their mother tongue is German/Russian/Japanese/etc. and there will always be people who think that Chinese/Turkish/Italian/etc sound cool and are fond of foreign culture :)
Good language video paul you are the best <U+0001F60E>
The AI may not destroy the language learning but surely will kill the dubbing industry.
When I try to speak Spanish with a native Spanish speaker, the reaction is always, <U+201C>cringe dude, just speak English<U+201D>
Turkish translation is really good. Not just grammar or vocabulary but also intonation and accent. It is not perfect though, yet you&#39;d have study Turkish for a decade to do it better than the AI.
Language learning is all about passion. There will be people who learn languages for instrumental purposes, but the richness you get from communicating in different languages and the knowledge you get from different cultures are priceless.<br>Great vid as always!

I&#39;m a native Mandarin speaker, yes, I&#39;m very impressed. I think it imitates how non-native people tried to learn Chinese: the tone is somewhat unnatural and a little robotic. When it says &quot;zhong guo ren&quot; (Chinese people), it&#39;s a very typical (or stereotypical) foreign accent. But overall, the tone is very good. The grammar is flawless. If a non-native speaker can speak Mandarin like this, I would say &quot;Your Mandarin is perfect!&quot;
That is crazy! Paul is going to take all our jobs! Turkish was almost perfect except for one small mistake in parallelism in tense in translation of <U+201C>he doesn<U+2019>t speak Turkish<U+201D> it had to be <U+201C>he is not speaking Turkish<U+201D> to sound right in Turkish.
Wow, here i was wondering for a while if i&#39;ll ever see a video a video on Ai vs Language learning. Great! Bygones are the days where people say &quot;sorry for bad [language] i helped myself with google translate&quot;. No. Now it&#39;ll be &quot;hi i am fluent in [language], even in A, B and C! I&#39;ll even put that on my CV, bcz f you! Also if you ask me to talk to you in [language] face to face, well f you i don&#39;t owe you any proof! (Aka chat gpt will &#39;write&#39; for me and some audio ai will &#39;speak&#39; for me)&quot;<br><br>This is... this is litterally the same case sc<U+00E9>nario as Ai genrating images at this point. A true detriment to actually learning a skill and an propeller for enabling laziness. A general derriment to &quot;being curious&quot;, really. Why all that? What&#39;s the point of having an Ai do this for you?
AI video didn&#39;t seems natural
I totally agree with your analysis. The pleasure I derive from learning, speaking, reading and listening to other languages will never be provided by AI translation. All that this new technology can do is send me back to my native language. So, what&#39;s the fun of it?
Honestly I was waiting for you to make a video on this topic since the day I came across this AI tool. It&#39;s like a real linguist finally coming face to face with an AI linguist.<U+0001F602>
<U+270C><U+FE0F>
Very interesting video! I don&#39;t think language learners need to fear the development of AI any time soon. Humans can give things meaning and interpret that meaning in many ways, whereas AI can only mimic patterns and know what patterns look like (be it a novel, an essay, and even facial expressions). Our individual uses of languages like slang, and the unique connections of multilingual speakers make between their languages cannot be replicated easily
I will personally never use these automatic translation tools unless it&#39;s mandatory at work.
As a Turk, I can say that the Turkish voice of AI was funny and good.
Love the way you teach and explain your points. You<U+2019>re funny but does not distract from the information you convey. Thank you!
If the Turkish and German natives were impressed by the AI results then I think language learning will become more of a niche interest as functional needs are taken care of by better iterations of AI. To those who say it won&#39;t replace dialects and localisations I would counter by asking how long a learner needs to get beyond functionality and to use idiom and dialect fluidly? Most will never get to that point.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=276">4:36</a>  What you say here, Paul, hits very close to home. I am American but learned how to speak Portuguese and Spanish. I founded an imports business in 1999; I import mostly handcrafted items from Latin America. Knowing the languages of my destination countries - and something about their cultures - has bridged the gaps and brought me closer to the people I&#39;ve done business with. This is something not taught in business school! (I have an MBA). I have had numerous instances where people felt honored that I would care enough to learn their language. I wish I had a lempira, a peso or a real for every time someone said to me something like, &quot;Of all the other Americans who have come down here, you are the only one to speak to us in our language.&quot;  And next year I celebrate 25 years in business. I feel that bridging the gap through language has had a lot to do with the longevity of my business. Please, people, don&#39;t lean on AI for everything!
I&#39;m a native german speaker and the german one seemed less AI than you speaking english <U+0001F602>
Interesting video.<br>As a professional translator, here are my two cents.<br>I use machine translators like DeepL or Google Translate in the same way that a driver uses their GPS system - it can speed up my work by giving me prompts. But there are two big &quot;buts&quot;.<br>Firstly, at least in my usual language combination, those systems can be OK-ish at very simple texts, but they flounder when the text has any level of complexity. Using them to generate texts that I would then post-edit would not be viable for me; it simply takes more time and effort than actually doing a translation. Those systems will eventually remove low-end translators from the market - those translators who spew out large quantities of poor-quality text for low prices. Clients simply won&#39;t pay that when they could get a text of equally poor quality from a machine translator for a lot less. Frankly, those translators won&#39;t be missed.<br>Secondly, and this is the huge elephant in the room for the developers of machine translation systems - their capabilities improved dramatically when the neural network model replaced the old statistical type. But I use these systems daily in my work, and (at least in my usual language combination) over about the past three years the quality has plateau&#39;d. (If you spell it like that - it looks a bit weird but never mind.) I keep hearing that the systems will keep on getting better, but for three-ish years, they simply haven&#39;t progressed in any noticeable way in my own professional experience. That is the reality, regardless of what the developers try to claim in various &quot;studies&quot; with extremely questionable methodology. The technology seems to have hit a glass ceiling.<br>Maybe a complete paradigm shift will come and revolutionise the technology again - it&#39;s certainly possible. But I suspect that if it does, it will bring such massive and shocking changes to every single area of human life that the question of how good AI is at language learning and translation will seem entirely unimportant compared with the existential challenges that humanity will face.<br>Anyway, love your videos, keep up the good work.
I<U+2019>m a native speaker of Chinese. The Chinese translation was pretty good. However I was actually confused. It meant something like <U+201C>they may find my level of fluency memorable<U+201D>. But the flow of speech was not so fluent and the choice of words was not natural. It sounded like a robot. The first time I heard it, I thought you mean <U+201C>the lack of fluency, which is a level of fluency, is memorable<U+201D>. I was genuinely confused.
I was like WTFFFF?!!??? I have a hangover and am lying in bed. All of a sudden I hear this and forget about all my sickness... Turkish sounds per-fect! Without ANY accent! I am scared...
Crowd sourcing: I deal with Youtube videos in Hebrew and Palestinian Arabic of people speaking in informal speech. Can anyone recommend specific software to translate speech into English subtitles? Better if it can also focus on people speaking when there&#39;s a lot of background noise. For Hebrew what I&#39;ve found is so-so. For Palestinian Arabic, software can&#39;t understand Arabic dialects.
I don<U+2019>t think an AI would look that tired <U+0001F606> love you dude
Turkish: you sounded robotic<br>Chinese and German sounded more natural, or it is just because these languages have certain patterns of stops when they are spoken. Your voiced changed in these two.
Imo AI language will be used by media and tourist especially by Americans who cant bother to learn another language everyone else will do like they&#39;ve always done
I could easily understand the language problems in your Turkish back in the days but since for few years turkish is loosing its own  spirit cause of immigration problems here in Istanbul so your ai translate is better then new Istanbul dialect!
for me as a Dutchman your german sounds soulles via AI
I think the AI tools could significantly decrease the amount of people who learn a language. Based on my own experience with language learning I could say that motivation is divided into 2 groups:<br> - Hard motivation: you move to another country and you need to communicate at work/shop/hospital, etc. Or you know that good English communication skills could increase your salary and give you an advantage in the job market<br>- Soft motivation: you like the language in general, you want to learn a new culture, you want to communicate with people about non-work topics,  make new friends, etc.<br><br>AI could fill all your needs in the Hard Motivation group. So, you would have much less motivation to learn it, unless you are enjoying the process in general. And i think most of people just quit it because it takes time and money.
German audio lacks reverberations, it feels off.
As a Turkish speaker, translation was 100% correct!
<U+05E4><U+05D5><U+05DC> <U+05D0><U+05E0><U+05D9> <U+05DE><U+05EA> <U+05E2><U+05DC><U+05D9><U+05DA>! <U+05D0><U+05E0><U+05D9> <U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05D4><U+05D1> <U+05DC><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05EA> <U+05D0><U+05EA> <U+05D4><U+05E1><U+05E8><U+05D8><U+05D5><U+05E0><U+05D9><U+05DD> <U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05DA>, <U+05D5><U+05E4><U+05EA><U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05DD> <U+05E2><U+05DB><U+05E9><U+05D9><U+05D5> <U+05DC><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05EA> <U+05D0><U+05D5><U+05EA><U+05DA> <U+05E8><U+05D5><U+05D0><U+05D4> <U+05D7><U+05D3><U+05E9><U+05D5><U+05EA> <U+05D1><U+05E2><U+05D1><U+05E8><U+05D9><U+05EA>, <U+05D1><U+05E9><U+05E4><U+05D4> <U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05D9> <U+05DE><U+05D7><U+05DE><U+05DD> <U+05D0><U+05EA> <U+05D4><U+05DC><U+05D1> <U+2764> <U+05E9><U+05DC><U+05D5><U+05DD> <U+05DE><U+05D9><U+05E9><U+05E8><U+05D0><U+05DC>!
The translation into Chinese is better than an average language learner but is still kind of bad (in both grammar and pronunciation). It will probably take some specialized patch to make it better.<br>The problem of the current generation of AI is that it takes some time to train and requires well-parametrized data, so it cannot capture the spontaneous changes of cultures or less documented phenomenons. <br>Also it probably cannot translate language-specific puns/phrases and get their meaning across well (just like human translators). I have deep understanding of two languages and I can say while translation can get most of the meanings across, they miss something big all the time. At this time when AI translation is still mostly on par with human translations, I don&#39;t think it is the time to say AI can kill language learning.
the tones of the passage in Chinese are a little weird but the words are generally understandable<U+3002>
That software translation thing is kinda fascinating
Take AI into the middle of a field and give it eternal rest. ;) <br><br>Seriously, IF AI can assist in providing practice for listening and speaking (especially correct speaking of a new language) BY ALL MEANS use AI to create Student-AI conversations. The AI should be able to calculate consistent errors in pronunciation and usage (provided it clearly identifies a real mistake!), and to provide that help to the student as practice short conversations outside of class.<br><br>&quot;... outside of class.&quot; Yes, the fact is that AI should NOT replace the teacher, but rather assist the student and teacher by providing the &quot;40 hours a day&quot; practice that TwoSet Violin claim are necessary to master any skill. Consider, learning could be as much as 40 hours a week (class time that is costly for almost anyone), but that could be accomplished with free student effort (a-hem!!!!) much better than with books, recordings to listen to but not interact with, etc.<br><br>One warning is that the AI, which could reasonably simulate a conversation similar to that of a Turning Test (!!!) it should be constrained from getting TOO personal. How that is accomplished represents the next step in language learning.
What about the possibility of AI assisting us in creating even more languages? I think that would also be a fun hobby!
As a person who has been learning Turkish for a year and can speak very fluently, that was pretty impressive..
AI will not be able to perfectly translate languages for a while and when we eventually get there it will be a far bigger deal than just translation since in order to perfectly translate you need to have a theory of mind, be able to understand social dynamics, understand and take into account context, etc. This is no longer a language model but an Artificial General Intelligence. For people who are unfamiliar with the term, there are two types of AI: Narrow and General. Narrow is every type of AI we currently have. They are not truly intelligent but are able to simulate it for a narrow range of tasks. General AI on the other hand is essentially an artificial human intelligence for all intents and purposes. These AIs are going to affect FAR more than just language learning. Also at the end of the day, untranslatables will always be a motivating factor for learning a language, to steal an example from Tom Scott, Shakespeare cannot be properly translated into French since the format of his writings rely on a feature of English that French simply does not have. Or a personal goal of mine is to read the Monogatari series in Japanese since it relies heavily on untranslatables.
The printing press didn&#39;t kill writing, tv didn&#39;t kill books, games didn&#39;t kill tv, etc.<br>People will always be interested in languages!
great video, and i agree with many of these sentiments.<br><br>on another note, would you be interested in doing a video on the macanese creole language? it has fewer than 50 speakers these days but recently i&#39;ve learned it to a certain degree and also started analyzing its grammar and morphology. i even translated a poem into macanese for fun. let me know what you think!
This means I&#39;ll be able to speak to people in Latin and be understood.
I&#39;m becoming IAphobic!
native german speaker here and for me it sounds very robotic. The grammar is completely correct but it doesn&#39;t really sound natural, like a native speaker.
The German was kinda good, but you can feel it<U+2019>s artificial? A bit robotic
This video makes a good point, but another youtuber I&#39;m subscribed to has a friend making an app to teach languages using AI, so it can go either way.
I feel somehow that culture-specific key elements of the dialogue will get lost in translation.
(Im from Germany)<br>Well i can say that this was not really you bc how &quot;you&quot; spoke. But actually it was pretty good and nearby the reality. Would be cool to see a video in which you speak german xD.
Absolutely yes in terms of communication. Everyone will be able to communicate easily.
It will just accelerate learning eventually and make learning very accessible
I remember the first time I talked to a French native speaker. It was just a phone call, but I was thrilled nevertheless. IA can&#39;t replace that feeling.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=259">4:19</a> And also for cognitive development!
Your question &quot;Will you still dedicate time to learning and practicing other languages if AI translation makes it unnecessary ?&quot;<br>My answer : Yes, I will. (Because it is intellectually stimulating.)
Language Geeks of the world UNITE! lol
Your cyborg AI version on thumbnail looked like David Draiman XDXD
Real-time Turkish was pretty good, not like native speakers, but very close to a foreigner speaking Turkish.
As someone that only speaks one language. The idea of total communication does sound quite intriguing. A tech version of the Babel Fish.<br><br>As long as it could be turned off. I don&#39;t need to hear AI dubbing, ruining all my favourite Japanese shows. If something can give automatic accurate subtitles. That would be amazing instead.
Very interesting that you posted this video. I never considered this reality <U+0001F622> I love your point about the point of language learning. People uninterested in languages don<U+2019>t really seem to understand why we actually study languages. It<U+2019>s very rarely for work or a resume <U+0001F602> It<U+2019>s for fun and mental challenge!
If European Portuguese sound like Russian, then Brazilian Portuguese sounds like Lithuanian, and that&#39;s coming from a Latvian. The only way I can distinguish, is by picking out words that I can recognize
Language learning is already DEAD, it just doesn&#39;t know it yet.. <br>HOHOHOHO<U+0001F385>    MEOWWW <U+0001F640>
As a native speaker of English, I&#39;ve never NEEDED to learn anything else and that&#39;s just a fact.   AI translation tools won&#39;t change that in any meaningful way.   Ill continue to learn for the same reasons I do now: it&#39;s fun and I like surprising people.
Many reasons to learn a language. I love learning Hebrew as I love it, I am Jewish and so it feels like my language and it is the language of holy text, well ancient Hebrew is. Its just fun to learn language and culture
<U+041C><U+043E><U+043B><U+043E><U+0434><U+0435><U+0446>, <U+041F><U+043E><U+043B>!
You have a great point at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYwG8LmjmI8&amp;t=276">4:36</a>. The experience of someone getting excited that you can speak their language can never be replaced no matter how advanced technology gets. I&#39;ve experienced it a few times with French, even though my French really isn&#39;t the greatest. They&#39;ll appreciate any earnest attempt. <br><br>Well done in presenting both sides of this argument. And yes, your AI translation into German sounded very stiff and formal.
The Turkish seemed &quot;good&quot; because there were no mistakes but they way you spoke seemed off. No one speaks like that in real life.
Artificial Intelligence probably won&#39;t replace absolutely everything because Politicians know that once Artificial Intelligence takes away all our jobs then that will lead to angry voters sitting in their house with nothing else to do except to vote pro Artificial Intelligence politicians out of political office at the election booths. Most likely Artificial Intelligence will replace some jobs because some rich business people want more money but more politicians will prevent Artificial Intelligence from taking every job as they need to secure votes from voters.
Ok that video translation software you demonstrated was kinda scary.
This is such a cool technology - I&#39;m amazed at the video! But I think an overlooked impact will be that it will (again/more) privilege large languages, while minority languages and signed languages will fall by the wayside. There&#39;ll be languages that are technologically privileged, and thus gain more traction and use worldwide, and languages that stay in their own bubble, pushed further out of the reach of the average person, media, etc.
Would be nice to see these tools used to help preserve endangered languages in a way that would make it accessible for people to learn interactively.
AI, if applied correctly, could actually improve the language-learning experience.  Things like autocorrect for grammar and even pronunciation, for example.  DeepL Write is an early attempt at that, although it currently only works for two Englishes (US &amp; UK) and Standard German.  Another thing could be something like the early versions of Memrise.  That is, an AI creating mnemonics for you to remember when you&#39;re struggling to create your own.  And that&#39;s just off the top of my mind.<br><br>Of course, we still have to wait until techbros are done playing and real professionals can finally take the stage to use the technology in a sensible way.
Language learning is so profoundly fulfulling.  I won&#39;t ever stop.
I<U+2019>m really not all that impressed by AI translations. They<U+2019>re incredibly bad at translating different levels of formal-informal speech. Take an Italian text that uses <U+2018>tu<U+2019>, translate it into French and it won<U+2019>t use French <U+2018>tu<U+2019> (literally the same word) but rather <U+2018>vous<U+2019>, which is much more formal. You will get the gist of what<U+2019>s being said but you<U+2019>ll suddenly feel like you<U+2019>re talking to some government agent rather than a potential friend.
The German pronunciation sounded artificial and the text didn&#39;t hit your usual register.
Turkish translation was very accurate and pronounciation is also good.
I was shocked hearing the Turkish one.<br>I was thinking it was you speaking.<br>Only for example was translated as urne which need to be said as urnak <br>which also isn&#39;t a good translation, it&#39;s better to say masala.<br>But all the other sentences were good.
The german ai translation sounds exactly like the translations used by scammers, so people won<U+2019>t trust you.
I speak on behalf of Turkish. The translation is incredibly good. If I didn&#39;t know the tone of your voice and saw a video of yours for the first time, I would definitely think you were a foreigner who later learned Turkish as his native language. Ofc, it isn<U+2019>t localised it, but perfect for formal conversations
Can AI help decipher ancient unread script?
The turkish and german were really good but the intonation was a bit off... like too monotone.... if that shit works in real time? wow.
AI will help you to learn hw to speak foreign tongues...in your own voice...and not sound like Duolingo or the voice on the language tape. It will show you how to mouth, as if looking into a mirror of the future. Bring it on! Bayarlala! Ngiyabonga!
the german parts are perfect in the words itself, like they are 100% perfect, but the pitch of the sentences itself doesnt feel right. its a bit &quot;robotic&quot; like 3 words 3 words 3 words the structure of the breaks feels false.<br>BUT if i hear that without context i would NEVER guess AI, its to good for that, i would think &quot;wtf is he speaking like that is he reading a telepromter or what&quot; xD
I don<U+2019>t think AI will ever replace the need for personal fluency for fields agents of intelligence/counterintelligence government agencies for reasons that should be pretty obvious. I also don<U+2019>t think that the need for language learning instruction will completely go away as long as countries require some degree of fluency, to avoid some kind of Tower of Babel situation if the technology ever fails. Totally agreed on the other personal reasons.<br>One upshot of AI might be the possibility of preserving endangered (but not critically endangered,) indigenous languages. If there<U+2019>s no longer a  huge sense of pressure to learn or communicate in English or another lingua franca and these languages can be used to to communicate with anyone there might be a resurgence in their use, at least in some communities where the technology is readily available.
Im fluent in portuguese, spanish and english is my third language. People using tech divises in order to translate stuff will never feel that satisfaction of understand something you really studied hard for. I can listen to music now that I used to listen when I was a child with the diference that now I can understand every single word, that feeling that you can understand something you used to struggle with just using your brain is something no tech devise can provide
I agree that AI translators will probably be something that we see in workplaces, but won&#39;t replace human curiosity. In college, I took Mandarin classes because I was fascinated by Chinese culture and wanted to learn the language. Now, I&#39;m starting to learn a little Aramaic in my spare time because that was Jesus&#39;s native tongue. In neither case do I expect to get any practical benefits from learning these languages, but I think learning them is still good for my mental health.
I think that, in the future, as soon as language learning loses a lot of its importance, those who speak other languages will perhaps be more valorized? Like, someone who could just wear glasses which translates our languages automatically to each other chose to learn and delve deeper into my language and culture. I would prefer that to the mechanical way.
I think that the world will start to move in the direction of most native English speakers, i.e. language learning is only done when truly needed or wanted. Because of English&#39;s status as the primary global link language, the average Anglophone doesn&#39;t really need to learn another language. The tools Paul described will likely serve a similar purpose for most of the world.
Never, language learning is a skill that helps develop communicative abilities and logical, emotional, and cultural thinking. The one who&#39;s able to speak more than one language knows that it means freedom, you don&#39;t need to rely on machines, computers etc. You have it and no one can take it from you.
I actually feel like AI will help all sorts of learning. I&#39;ve been using it for coding mostly, but also for some grammar questions, and the great thing about it is that it can work like asking a teacher. You can give specific parameters for a question and get a detailed step-by-step answer.<br>I think it does pose a danger to the job of the language teacher and the translator, as it can to translations very quick and without the mistakes you used to typically see when people use Google Translate or or dictionaries.<br><br>With inflation being on the up and up for the foreseeable future, my guess is that a lot of people will prefer AI tools to actual people, as it&#39;s likely to be cheaper by comparison, even if it lacks the social aspect that is also conducive to learning.
I studied Latin and Ancient Greek in school and I also learned Sardinian, just because it was the language of my ancestors, so no, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll stop learning languages just because of AI. If anything, AI-aided learning programs will be a way to get input much more immersively than a traditional textbook or application like Duolingo.
Cool premier.
AI could help us to learn languaged. Assuming that it is able to make no mistakes.  English,  for example,  is becoming a meaningless drivel.
Listening to the German part I can state that it&#39;s consistently high German without any regional accent. Using a regional accent is something a native speaker does automaticly and thus giving you a hint about where exactly he/she is from. AI won&#39;t - unless it&#39;s trained to mimic a certain accent. Regional accents spoken by people from that region are something only real human to human communication can provide. For me these accents are a big part of what makes a language interesting.
Woaaah
So you think that a mass adoption of Neurolinks and AR glasses is more probable then most people learning a common language, presumably English?
Used word &quot;Kill&quot; in the title. Demonitized!!<br><br>Will AI Unalive Language Learning!? Sus AF Fam! <br><br>Language Learning Prank Gone Wrong! <U+0001F631><br><br>There, I just increased your zoomer demographic!

Not very sure if I will stop learning a language if the AI is translating, still it&#39;s fun to understand a language, sometimes...
Learning Japanese, Chinese using AI tools. Best experience ever. <U+0001F60C>
I learn languages so I can communicate with the world not the world to talk to me
Learning other languages also improves your native language.
Just amazing!
Love from Nepal <U+2764> Make video about Nepali language(Oldest South Asian country)
I believe that AI won&#39;t replace Language learning<br>But AI is very helpful in learning a language<br>I myself learning Mandarin Chinese with the help of Google Bard <br>And yes YouTube, Duolingo also
<U+200B>The Turkish version does not sound natural because it is translating on the go
Yes
In order to compete with AI, governments across the globe should consider the idea of making teaching foreign languages a compulsory part of their education system where for example, Spanish should be taught from preschool until college in the Philippines and the United States.
Language models may be good at learning, but the lifecycle of  slang in the age of the internet is like trying to chase Roadrunner going at light speed. And some slang is so multilayered or becomes so multilayered that it may <U+2018>confuse<U+2019> it.
Thanks a lot! Finally Paul notices this!
No because I learn(ed) languages to connect with people
Now <b>that&#39;s</b> a thumbnail
Personally, when I learn a language, most of the words I learn come from a teacher. However, I also believe that Google Translate would probably be better off as a dictionary for single words or short phrases and I occasionally use it to try and improve my vocabulary.
the only thing it&#39;s gonna kill is art, just like autotune killed singing
Well as a professional language tutor I already feel like I&#39;ve been automated away by A.I. , because no one hires me anymore even though I&#39;m clearly great at my job and used to be quite successful, and I assume it&#39;s because everyone has flocked to free automated learning resources. And while my heart is happy that language learning is no longer gated behind having money, my wallet (and my paranoia about misinformation being potentially taught frequently by automated resources) is kinda peeved at this, heh
I don<U+2019>t even need to watch the video to know the answer: no. AI may augment the language learning process<U+2014>dramatically, in fact, but it can<U+2019>t kill the invaluable human-to-human connection that actually learning someone else<U+2019>s native language affords.
If Doctor Zamenhof lived today, he could have invented another language beside Esperanto to mesmerize AI.
Lotta potential for it to become artificial and make language more science than culture, but It would make it a lot easier. This might be the base of the ai fault Ian bargain
This is going to be interesting. My experience is the opposite, Chatgpt is so useful for language learning! Anytime I have a teacher to correct immediately the stories I write in other language to practice or ask technical grammar questions.
Nah, not with the generative kind. Maybe in the future with quantum, but we can only guess.<br><br>It&#39;s good for making json files though.
Gonna tune in, I&#39;ve been wondering about this.
Maybe it can replace texting a bit but the shared experiences and nuance of a language can&#39;t be communicated through AI translation. The translation would have to be a full-on language course of footnotes to properly get all the meanings across.

hi,what version chatGPT you use ?
Terima kasih.
So - is every language actually represented in Chat GPT?  No - not really.  Even the languages that are represented are not equally represented.<br><br>And really - do you need ChatGPT to give you a study plan of 30 minutes a day?<br><br>Also - frequency lists can only be generated from the training data - for lesser represented languages those frequency lists may not be as useful - and learning only high-frequency words is not the best way to learn vocabulary. Note- 1000 words is not a very large vocabulary, it&#39;s not even enough to complete CEFR A1 for either French or English.  Finally - there are a ton of vocabulary lists already created for anki that you can already download - not sure what Chat GPT is adding here.<br><br>The spoken language does not sound natural at all - the French was ...  really bad.  Russian too - and that was just &#39;hello&#39;.<br><br>And we can see how poorly it detects your speech.<br><br>This <i>might</i> get you some basics, but it&#39;s not going to get you fluent, especially not in a rarer language.  (Note - only about 50 languages are supported on ChatGPT - so that is limiting right there).  Hope you aren&#39;t interested in any African languages...<br><br><a href="https://botpress.com/blog/list-of-languages-supported-by-chatgpt">https://botpress.com/blog/list-of-languages-supported-by-chatgpt</a><br><br>Perhaps consider interacting with an actual human speaker of your target language?  There are a lot of resources for that.  There are also a lot of free resources available that will get you through A2 in pretty much any language you are interested in, if you want better than that (a decent target for &#39;fluency&#39; is B2), you will probably want to use resources that will cost money.  I&#39;m not saying it is impossible to get there entirely through self-study from only free materials, but it will be faster and easier with at least one other human in the mix who speaks as good or better than your target level and who can explain what is going on (linguistically) on the fly.
haha don&#39;t hang out with your friends and join a cult! -got it!
These are just tips and require a lot of thinking but require no commitment. However you can use them as extra tools.
<U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>
There seems to be nothing you can do to have it slow it&#39;s chat down. I have tried asking it and it only does it a couple of rates slower. I find it is still far to quick.
Gran bel video. Grazie! Credo che siamo solo all<U+2019>inizio di un percorso che render<U+00E0> sempre pi<U+00F9> facile apprendere nuovi linguaggi. C<U+2019><U+00E8> chi auspica addirittura che non sar<U+00E0> nemmeno pi<U+00F9> necessario farlo. Ma dove sarebbe poi il divertimento? <U+0001F605>
Yes, i totally agree. You can learn a language with AI. Immersive translate will help you choose a search engine such as DeepL Chatgpt and Gemini. It also translates pdfs and other texts free of charge.
How do I get it to talk back. I am only getting typed responses. I can talk to it using my mic. Thank you.
I am norwegian/ jeg er norsk
I tried it and it sucks. Too complicated to actually create something senseful at your level of language. It cant really pronounce words correctly. It pronounces French words with English pronunciation...
Great Video!<br>Why did you choose the North Korean flag on the thumbnail to represent the Korean language?
I have never met anybody who spoke a language fluently by learning it from AI.  However, it is a very useful tool for language learning.
Where are those settings located? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jwtv1rRa-A&amp;t=469">7:49</a>  are those GPT4 settings? bc I can&#39;t find them on the iPhone
Great video.  Thank you so much. The information was wonderful, it is much appreciated.  Keep up the good work.
Just discovered your channel, liked and subscribed, I will be attempting to learn conversational french in 10 weeks and really hoping this will give me a great start.
brilliants thx for the content
Ukraine)) I greet you!
how can i change the language accent on CHATGPT? It is talking to me in italian with english accent
Do u need chatgtp plus for the voice chat feature? Or is it not available on android?
The chatgpt&#39;s mistakes happen because the AI translate every thing to one language
<U+975E><U+5E38><U+597D><U+7684><U+3002>  Wondering, is that the free or paid version? Somebody with access to ChatGPT can tell me? If paid, there are other apps that are build on top of ChatGPT for language learners, yourteacherAI, TalkPal, LanguaTalk, Gliglish, GoPenPal and a few more.
&quot;Join a cult&quot;.<br>This looks like a plan to me.
Chat gpt is not free. Nothing else to say.
I don&#39;t get it. Did you talk to Chat GPT? Or what was it? If yes, how can I install the same extension to communicate with Chat GPT for language learning? Thanks
I need have GPT4 or I can do the same with GPT3.5?
The French pronunciation of the AI was not the best. Spanish was perfect. It sounded very much like a bilingual native English-Spanish speaker reading French text with a basic understanding of the pronunciation.
i speak tamil
What platform do you use to have conversations? Are you using a specific Chat gpt plugin?
Why does Norwegian sound like sim talk.
I&#39;m trying to practice Spanish, but when the computer talks it sounds very &#39;gringo&#39; (por favor sounds &#39;pour fave-or&#39; instead of &#39;por fah-voor&#39;. Is there any way you can make Chat GPT fix this so I&#39;m not learning bad habits?
Tried this today and I am loving the AI back and forth conversation. It feels like I&#39;m talking with a real person. And I need consistent practice throughout the day to become fluent.

One of the great things you can ask chat GPT is to include the 6-8 spaces between the norwegian and english vocab list. it means you can easily cover the screen on one side and memorise the opposing words.
This seems so complicated <U+0001F622>
a step forward. one issue is when it<U+2019>s talking you can<U+2019>t see the text which would help

I don<U+2019>t know 10 languages,but I do know 6 of them. Judging from what I heard in this video, I wouldn<U+2019>t learn languages from chatGPT, pronunciations are not accurate. That&#39;s a big no-no<U+0001F645><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F><U+0001F645><U+0001F3FB><U+200D><U+2640><U+FE0F>

Amazing content! Thanks!
I&#39;ve been testing and it has some flaws...<br><br>The best thing about it is it can generate some word quiz that you can try to answer.<br><br>Or as a translator... At least it can do multiple translations at once. I learn French and Spanish, and when I use a normal translator, I have to manually change the language options to go back and forth between French and Spanish. But I can ask ChatGPT to translate it to French &amp; Spanish at the same time.<br><br>Guess translator apps should be worried by this AI ...<br><br>And the flaws are : it doesn&#39;t have a built-in speaker that sounds like native. Some translator/language learning apps have better speakers. In translator app, you can at least replay/re-listen again in slow speed.<br><br>It&#39;s good for some of my needs, but I still wouldn&#39;t recommend this to people who seriously wants to learn languages. There are apps out there designed for language learning that included AI technology.<br><br>Just not free <U+0001F601>.

This is so funny that you made this video as I have started using ChatGPT to help improve my Norwegian. The written component is crazy strong, but, as you said, the pronunciation is wonky. I wonder if they are working on that. I would find it particularly interesting if they could develop it far enough that it could also coach a person on pronunciation. I really like the ability to ask questions in Norwegian and have it correct my Norwegian and explain what I did wrong.

Too bad Chat GPT doesn&#39;t give you a good accent(or intonation for tonal languages) so that defeats the purpose, unless you want to learn to speak Chinese or Thai in American accent with bad tones lol
Im using the exact same prompt but Im not getting the same results. Any suggestions?
You look like Eliezer from Vida Infinda

Tolles Video, ich hab schon lange Chat-GPT  Plus abonniert und frage mich wieso ich nicht selbst darauf gekommen bin die KI zum Sprachen lernen zu benutzen.

THank you for the video
Good morning how&#39;s it going <U+0001F31E> I speak 5 languages french Spanish Portuguese criollo English <U+2764> I want to speak Italian
You can<U+2019>t really learn ANY language with this. Not yet. I tried gpt4 with a more obscure one that nevertheless still has millions of native speakers and checked its accuracy and it wasn<U+2019>t great. It was confidently incorrect.<br><br>I<U+2019>d hold off on anything but popular languages you<U+2019>re sure that ChatGPT knows well.
What if I don&#39;t have GPT4 and won&#39;t subscribe, but doing Anki myself feels tedious?
Gracias infinitas desde Venezuela.
Does it teach Finnish cases also. If, how to remember them in many situations? What about if it impossible to remember how to use them and in which situation?
Where can i find the prompt, thanks?
Wow. A language learning video that is actually useful. Subscribed!

Ai is going to breathe for us. You are terrific.
I use both Windows and Android - no Apple anything.  So I don&#39;t have any of those buttons/menus/prompts you showed.  Can you do a very short video on Android or Windows showing just how to set up/access the ChatGPT?  I think once you&#39;re in the program it should be similar.  Thanks.   FYI.  I tried doing this through searches and my screens look NOTHING like what you showed and it doesn&#39;t show the options you mentioned.  Thanks.
Been using many things to learn languages, once this is more accurate, that is a solid way of teaching, as far as how productive its good for conversations, I asked for a stimulation and I gave the AI an age and background and occupation, then if I got stuck in practicing language I asked how to to say &quot;blank&quot; in target language and it explained in english then switched to target language to include in dialogue. Only thing if you want learn things slowly its not for you, AI lists things incredibly fast, it only slows down if in simulation conversation. I am impressed might actually get chatgpt plus now I am convinced.
gran tutorial Andy!!!! muchas gracias por tu contribucion...Im actually an english coach/teacher for spanish speaking people and got a computer science degree... you just created a step by step method to learn any language and that&#39;s exactly where most people get discouraged ,,because they don&#39;t know how to do it,,,they don&#39;t know the ways to learn,,, props 2 u mate and cheers from the Panama Canal.
My ChaGpt version does not support audio, what am I doing wrong? I downloaded about a month ago.
Wow ..This is awesome....thanks for sharing Andy
The main problem is that it will start talking back even if you just have a tiny pause between your sentences. It should wait longer or be better at knowing when you are finished talking.
Really cool vid! Takk <U+0001F60A> i have been learning swedish for quite a long time. Didn&#39;t start with chatgpt though but lately i use it and ask it to write me short stories in swedish <U+0001F60A> or even talk about music and movies in swedish with chatgpt ...  I still stick to youtube for grammar analysis and explanations <U+0001F60A> and I try to read literature (ebooks) and listen to podcasts in order to expand my vocabulary and listening skills. Since i live in Greece (greek mother tongue), it is not that easy to find people to practice speaking... The trick you showed on the video... I had no idea we could use chatgpt to practice speaking actually!!! Thanks a lot <U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A>

My ChatGPT4 keeps hitting a wall when doing the second prompt, &quot;Can you give me the top 150 Greek words for each module With English Translations in a list?&quot;. This is not new for this specifically, but I find that other &quot;intensive&quot; prompts like these, often fails. Any suggestions how to overcome this?

# I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God&#39;s Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray... God bless you as you share this message to others.
Thanks, I appreciate this content, Muchas gracias amigo!!!
Hi Andy. I commondeered someone elses language prompt and generalised it so u can learn any language, i also reduced it to syntax so its only 950 characters and you can finetune it how u want it. Note that The first response we will get sounds weird only because we havnt chosen a language yet and its translating nothing but once we choose one it works great. Il leave the prompt in a reply to this one for easy copy paste
hi andy, i paid por gptplus but i dont have that function... please tell me why ??????&#39;

Pretty cool! Can you do the same for drawing with dall-e 3?
This is actually pretty cool, but I would like to have an option to make it talk slower when saying something in the target language. I&#39;ve tried practicing some German, but it was too fast for me
Dank voor deze leerzame video!
Arabic
Your Norwegian is really poor, obviously! Hahaha, fun! It didn&#39;t understand my Swedish when I talked &quot;sk<U+00E5>nska&quot; either, I had to make it more &quot;Swedish&quot;.
Very good stuff ! <U+0001F44D>
Join a Cult? <U+0001F62E>
It&#39;s an excellent way for learning vocabulary systematically, however, pronunciation is everything! I hope there will be a tool in future to do this similar to the language tools that already exist
Great Video
It pronounce foreign languages with a strong English accent tho, kinda like Google assistant does.<br><br>The fix is probably having multiple Text2Speech languages in the software that automatically switch when asked
Will this amazing voice GPT come to android too or should I switch to Apple?
TQ ,travelling is easy now !

What&#39;s the point of learning a language when AI is going to retire all people active in the field of translation
I think AI is an excellent tool to learn a different language. I&#39;ve been trying to learn Hebrew and I don&#39;t have anyone to talk to except for friends on zoom who also want to practice. Nothing is perfect though, I went to a zoom meeting today and it was more about bonding in English than practicing Hebrew. Not all meetings are created equal. If I can talk to ai and say for example-I&#39;m worried about the economy. And it answeres &quot;The American economy is sound, there are lots of jobs out there&quot;. Ok, I want to talk more about that but I want to hear it again and again before I expound more deeply on the subject. My friends on zoom would not tolerate so much repeats. They would throw me out of the group, ai would not.
its a great honor that you are learning the persian  <U+0645><U+0648><U+0641><U+0642> <U+0628><U+0627><U+0634><U+06CC><U+062F> <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>

As an English teacher myself, I must say I found your video to be incredibly captivating, especially when you highlighted the possibility of language learners engaging in conversations with chatbots. However, one concern that arises is the level of meaningfulness in such interactions. It brings to mind the analogy of chess. Despite the fact that computer chess games possess intricate techniques and delve into greater depths than any human chess game, they tend to receive less attention from spectators. Chess enthusiasts, instead, find more significance in watching two human players engage in a match rather than witnessing a battle between two computers.
Very useful. Many thanks indeed!
I use ChatGPT to practice my languages often. I just ask Chat GPT to practice Spanish (for instance) with me and correct me on major mistakes and it will hold a conversation with me and ask engaging questions for as long as I want. <br><br>You know, voice to text and text to voice already exists. It<U+2019>s on my iPhone keyboard. It<U+2019>s not far off to think someone can just add transcription for my voice to go from voice to text and then dictation for Chat GPT to go from text to voice and then add a fake CGI face and boom you have a language tutor that you can practice with with unlimited time. You<U+2019>re talking and it<U+2019>s interacting and talking about in your target language. <br><br>Very soon, someone will do this. Mark my words.
My ParadotChatAI says it&#39;s written in its own language..what does this mean?  <U+0001F914>
The simplest possible language is a monogrammar <U+261D> language <U+0001F4DC>. The grammar rule <U+278A> of a sentence existing is all the grammar needed. <U+0001F606><br><br><br>Directly translating a monogrammar <U+261D> language <U+0001F4DC> into the non-monogrammar <U+274C><U+261D> languages <U+0001F4DC><U+0001F4DC><U+0001F4DC> humans <U+0001F465><U+0001F465><U+0001F465><U+0001F465> have results in gibberish <U+0001F635><U+200D><U+0001F4AB>.<br><br>Thus, in order to translate a monogrammar <U+261D> language <U+0001F4DC>, you need to know a monogrammar <U+261D> language <U+0001F4DC>.<br><br><U+2014>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Anyway, the point is, it is useful for AI <U+0001F916>, as it is modular, and easy to start learning. It can also be used as a reference for understanding common human languages. <U+0001F606>
I mean you can use AI to generate completely original stories containing vocabulary or other linguistic parameters that you want to learn or to drill. For example, I use OpenAI and I can instruct it to generate for example a one-hundred word story including the terms &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;newsreader&quot; and &quot;flight of stairs&quot;, as well as any other high or low frequency words and various tenses or conventions that I tell it to.
We were born the same day! Maybe, that&#39;s way I love your videos so much! You do always a great job for all of us!
Hey Steve, what do you think of using Chatbot GPT-3 from openAI? Its an language model which is trained on 46TB of text in all kind of languages. you can tell it for example to write its responses as an child or if you have a character based language like Japanese to put the reading behind parenthesis. Would this be revolutionary as an language learning tool?
The fasted way to become <b>conversational</b> in  <i>Any</i> language is immersion.  Period.  Like a baby listens to their parents language long before they ever start speaking themselves. Reading, writing, grammar, etc. are learned <i>after</i> becoming minimally conversational.<br><br>As a no-nothing beginning new/second language learner - I think when attempting to speak a language with a native speaker, then they look at you with disdain ( unworthy of their consideration) it really hurts.  Thus the key is either get the courage to develop a Thick skin, or find a patient compassionate partner.  I have a hard time finding a patient compassionate partner, and I am human enough (not a sociopath) to accept that rejection is deeply disheartening. <br><br>This is where AI fits.  If I can spend time with an AI audio chatbot, as a beginner.  Learning first the basic and most often used words and phrases, and being corrected in my pronunciation until it is at least understandable (not perfect or flawless), this would go a Long way to boost initial confidence.  AI never gets tired or frustrated with a lack of progress.  I would be able to converse in perhaps 100 words, (or more) comfortably.  The AI audio bot would work to help me crawl before I attempt to walk.  At some point, I would matriculate into real human based conversation interactions - with <i>Far Less Fear</i> of embarrassment and humiliation.  Moreover, my human language partner counterpart wouldn&#39;t get so quickly exhausted in attempting to diagnose what I am &quot;trying&quot; to say.   <br><br>AI should be that first 500 word and 100 phrase learning platform.  Again, no need at all for perfection, just a level of pronunciation equivalent to someone speaking with a thick accent. It is the kindergarten class, which elevates the learners <b><i>confidence in learning</i></b> more than the learning itself that is so important at the beginning.
The open AI audio to text app is actually the best tool if you want to have a good transcription

I<U+2019>m an American who moved to Iceland and eventually became a citizen.  I have probably an A2 level proficiency in Icelandic, and Google Translate has been a key survival tool to deal with professional level Icelandic.<br><br>Now that I am an Icelandic citizen, I<U+2019>m using input-based methods to improve.  AI translations available with a click or tap allow me to understand new words without interrupting my reading flow.  It<U+2019>s wonderful and I am seeing huge benefits after only a month or so.<br><br>I used Google Translate for a first draft of my cover letter for the citizenship application and a little care with checking the result and editing made it something that got me compliments from proficient Icelandic readers.  Is it a substitute for my own proficiency? No! But, as a tool for getting by, it<U+2019>s awesome.
Steve how many languages do you speak near native level of proficiency<br>And with number languages mastery you must spend many hours each day learning

I have ever watched over 50 videos by Steve Kaufmann. <br>I definately can say it&#39;s the best T-shirts I have ever seen.<br>Happy birthday Steve! From Japan!
Did you mean that exactly when you said you don<U+2019>t want your tutor to correct you in conversation?? I<U+2019>m a beginner and thought that was part of having a tutor?
Happy birthday! I believe there are many people out there who would feel more at ease practicing speaking interaction with a bot, because they won&#39;t feel shy, and AI could be a good solution for them, don&#39;t you think so?
Happy birthday, Steve!
Felicidades!! yo en unos d<U+00ED>as cumplo 55, los dos con n<U+00FA>meros repetidos...<U+0001F603><br><br>A m<U+00ED> me gustar<U+00ED>a algo como LingQ, que registrara las palabras nuevas y cuando volvieran a salir poder buscar en qu<U+00E9> frases me salieron las veces anteriores (no s<U+00E9> si esto se puede hacer en LingQ), y poder ir cambi<U+00E1>ndolas de color seg<U+00FA>n las voy aprendiendo, pero que se pudiera usar con cualquier idioma, no solo en los que est<U+00E1>n registrados, ya que yo quiero aprender algunos idiomas muy raros que me temo que nunca van a entrar. <U+00BF>Ser<U+00ED>a posible hacerlo?
Having been a language learner in the late &#39;80s, a Chinese learner in the 90s in China, coming back to language learning in the 2020s: I truly feel like I&#39;m in the future.<br><br>Tapes CDs recordings are all good but the barrier to be able to access to me seems more what you&#39;re talking about peripherally on artificial intelligence.<br><br>Because of my learning disabilities I have been using speech to text in English for a long time. This has given me the access to be able to quickly put down my thoughts literally again an access issue. <br><br>The gatekeeping for material is not completely gone but days when you tune in on world band radio hoping to get signals is because a couple rudimentary searches will usually help you acquire native speakers talking about common issues. YouTube is amazing for this. <br><br>Google translate and the camera function can be able to help you with languages that you may not have any reason to learn. Overtime that AI can look at and hold all that data of all the various languages and rules and be able to do predictive kind of future stuff: like with Google analytics of how many times certain words have been searched being able to predict future language usage. <br><br>Or being able to go back into enough historical context that an anthropologist can be able to waive their phone over symbols literally giving people starting points on languages that are long dead.<br><br>It&#39;s a really great topic and it only gets weirder and more banal in a way that is unexpected. Love your videos thank you
(Knowing that&#39;s only on the edge of AI) But I find the Text to Speech so good in the web version of LingQ that I now make 3-5 minutes lessons consisting of sentences and words I&#39;m having trouble with--or have just recently come across. I often take sentences and words in emails from friends or short things I find online (or from LingQ lessons from my tutors) and just add them to a Google doc or Google Translate.  I make sure to have period at the end of every sentence or word. I often repeat the hardest words, sometimes before or after the sentence.  Then, when I have 3-5 minutes of content, just make new LingQ lesson with these words/sentences--and ask LingQ to auto-generate the audio. I can&#39;t speak for all languages, but in Hebrew, it&#39;s amazing!  Not sure I&#39;d want to listen to a whole story or long article this way, but for review and new/interesting sentences with lots of new words, it works great!
We&#39;re not there yet (because it&#39;s still too slow for now), but I envision an AI which, in real-time, draws an image of the sentence/paragraph, giving one a direct and immediate visual of what was said or written.<br><br>For now, we can tie a translator to an AI image service like Midjourney/Stable Diffusion, but it takes a few minutes per image normally, and needs work to optimize the outputs for this particular use-case. But technology&#39;s rate of improvement is still exponential :)
This channel deserves a more than million subscribers. This is the only learning language topic that I follow up. Thanks Mr. Kaufmann! I have a question, is Google Translate homepage is appropriate and suitable for a beginner to learn a new language, because the teachers in the courses that I took doesn<U+2019>t allow me to do it? What are other sources besides Google Translate do you recommend then? Appreciate your help.
Wow happy birthday Steve! Nice shirt!
Parab<U+00E9>ns pra voc<U+00EA>, Mr. Kaufmann <U+0001F1E7><U+0001F1F7> <br>I started on my own by daily discipline an inmersive methodology to practice French due to the fact that I had done a short summer interchange cultural course many years ago and by not putting it into practice forgot quite almost of it, but u know some fun facts that happens to me is that I gain accent quickly manner and after been for such many years not speaking my native language PT some of the less useful words I tend to forget and find myself trying to explain within a context to express myself sometimes <U+0001F914>
Many comments welcome AI, but I<U+2019>m curious how many people here would want to have a computer chip, such as NeuroLink imbedded into their brain, to greatly increase their abilities to learn and obtain any information, such as language?
Happy birthday Steve  for 77 that is still young nice golf shirt I injoy watching ur channel I just started learning Japanese it is fun  I do it by audio on a CD player and follow with the book  anyway happy birthday <U+0001F382>
Just found the channel, it is amazing thank you very much and happy birthday Steve!
Happy birthday Steve.. You like amazing for your age.   !
What scares me the most is that AI and the further development of such technologies might do learning languages pointless and unnecessary
Here&#39;s what will happen. The instant or near enough translation will happen through some kind of wearable device and so on or it will be good enough and will be used widely for travel. Travellers can already wing it with Google on their phones in foreign countries. So perhaps a new status will be given to those who speak natural language. Probably it will be like watches. The fact that people still buy analogue watches and they are a high status object. The broader question of where society is going is more tricky. If everything is done for us then what? The problem is the profits driving all this technology seldom think about the broader consequences.
Great stuff Steve many happy returns of the day!... The AI stream was a instructive and helpful. Keep up the good work kind regards Worrell Robinson
Happy birthday! 77!
Very useful information. Thanks so much
Hi. I am curious as to what LingQ uses to determine the time signatures in our recordings. I provide the mp3 file and transcript and LingQ quite accurately places the sentences on the timeline. That is, there must be an analysis of the recording that Steve, modestly mentioned, and a comparison with the transcription. I wonder what is behind this - a Google service, some other cloud or an in-house solution?
I was hoping for an AI that can suppress all noise in a video that isn&#39;t speech and you can control it with a volume knob. Also, OpenAI open sourced Whisper that does state of the art speech to text. I haven&#39;t tried it, but it may be better than happy scribe and free.
Happy birthday Steve! Nice shirt.
It would be very helpful to get support from AI for language learning. Importing eBooks into LingQ is very helpful, but this does not change the text. From experience I can say that every time I&#39;m starting a new book in another language it&#39;s difficult. At first it is very tedious, towards the end it gets better. But if I imagine that I could adjust the level of each chapter to my current level... That would be so great. It would support my motivation even more.
Happy Birthday! You got a nice present :)<br>Transcribe is very useful, and I also use Deepl almost daily.
Happy birthday! Kr<U+00E1>sn<U+00E9> narozeniny!
Happy Birthday Steve!!! Happy for all you&#39;ve done with Lingq it&#39;s help me so much I also love listening to your videos they are very interesting and helpful. Hope you have many more years! Prayers!
Happy Birthday Steve!
Creative uses! I like the idea of search of materials with given grammatical structure.
I think a tireless chatbot trained with a lot of real input could be very useful. You can tweak the chatbot to be extremely emotionally salient, mostly by having it agree with you.  Having that bot map out and systematically expand your vocab could be great.<br><br>Another use I can see is having your chat bot join conversations with you and a native speaker as sort of a more human-like interpreter. That way you can turn to your bot and ask for specific vocab or concepts.  The bot could also instead of correcting you, reflect what you said better, which as a teacher I find much more useful than correcting.
<U+0001F44D>
Hi. I am delighted with the quality of the SI translation DeepL. I think it is much better than Google Translate (although that too is improving). I&#39;ve been using it for several years now. As well as using Ivona speech synthesiser, which was ahead of its time - unfortunately Amazon bought it out and is unlikely to develop it.
There was an interesting chat robot for Chinese, Lily I think it was called. Supposed to be leading edge ai. Would be interested to try it. Or read reviews
Happy Birthday Steve :),<br>every interesting to get your opinion on this topic. I have just recorded today my next video, which is also about AI and machine translation :). What a coincidence!
Steve rocks
Hi Steve, happy birthday. On potential uses that could be implemented right now - on your first use case - I wonder if you could use an algorithm akin to Netflix&#39;s algorithm for recommending content, which is remarkably effective. On your second point, I would consider partnering with Speechify - they do exactly what you&#39;re talking about which is making an excellent, AI-powered, realistic text to speech. It&#39;s pretty good and has a range of languages. I already use it in my language learning across different sites.
Happy Birthday Steve!<br><br>I personally find things like Google Translate fairly useful for checking to see if I&#39;m building sentences correctly. Instead of it telling me what I say, I make an attempt at forming the sentence in the target language, and then see if I&#39;m right. <br>However, I find it struggles quite a bit with the verbal conjugations of the Romance languages, especially when you&#39;re trying to write something in the form of past tense used for literature (Passato Remoto, per esempio). Initially, this was very confusing to me. I suspect it would also struggle with the case systems of languages like German and the Slavic languages. Someone who is studying such languages can possibly verify this. If Google Translate doesn&#39;t have a context for what you&#39;re trying to say, it can be off target quite badly, and this is something that only a language learner would be able to notice, and this explains the gulf of difference in opinion between casual users and language learners about how good such programs are. I think they definitely have a certainly utility but also have a long way to go before they can replace a human translating.
Happy Birthday Steve and happy golfing !!:)
Happy birthday <U+0001F382>

Happy birthday <U+0001F38A>
Happy Birthday Steve! So, your birthday is near Thanksgiving Day. I am deeply thankful for your inspiration and advice on language learning through many years of following you on social media. I wish you the best; health, prosperity and happiness.
First of all happy birthday the very best polyglot hehe, wish you live long and healthy always, i&#39;ve ever use Google assistant to chat with me in english but it didn&#39;t work out for me i just saying random things to her( feamale speaker)<br>I wish i have Siri to practice my english i think Siri is better than Google Asistant.
Happy birthday Steve <U+0001F340>! Do you speak Greek? What is the fastest way to learn Greek? I&#39;m fluent in English and German.
The artificial text to speech voices are all already amazing. At times you have to stop and ask yourself if it&#39;s a human or computer.
Happy Birthday <U+0001F338>
Happy level up!<U+0001F64C><U+0001F490>
We have almost the same birthday :) Happy birthday, Steve!
Happy birthday, Steve! Your ideas have been of great value for many years to my work as a teacher. I may not always agree entirely, but I have always profited from the challenge that you bring to my own understanding. Warm wishes. (And yes, LingQ is an important part of my personal study.)
All the best!

Happy birthday Steve!!! You&#39;re getting wiser and more knowledgeable about language learning as you get older and thanks for sharing it to your subscribers. More birthdays to come and good health..
Otter AI app.  Great!
thank you so much, i can&#39;t undertand all things you talk, but it provide some information for me, it help me improve my skill listent english
Hope one day AI would be good as human in terms of communication. So, we could practice speaking in the target language with them.

Happy birthday sir from India
Thank you Steve for sharing your thought.<br>Happy Birthday.
Hey Steve! First off, Happy Birthday! I do machine learning for my profession and am a polyglot for pleasure. I have the goal to someday marry the two and focus on AI for languages. You mentioned some clear use cases of AI that are already in practice. But I think we can dream even bigger. Imagine if the AI knew every word you were exposed to in a target language by tracking all of the videos you watched, books read, etc. (obviously this is where ethical questions are raised about data acquisition in AI.) But having access to all this information would allow the AI to know exactly where your weaknesses were, what words you needed to review (think spaced repetition on steroids) and then would tailor a new short story, lesson plan, or even find authentic content rich in those areas you needed to study. No more tracking your own word lists and only counting words when you actively reviewed your flashcards. You would instead just be constantly watching/listening to content that was exactly what you needed to hear in that moment. <U+0001F62E><U+0001F92F>
Hey, Steve! Many many happy returns of the day. Congratulations on being 77. Have a blast!
Happy Birthday Steve! I just had my birthday the 2nd. Thanks for the years of helpful language learning and for sharing your knowledge!
Happy birthday Steve, hope you live for way more years.

Feliz anivers<U+00E1>rio
I want A.I to be my and my son&#39;s best friend in learning, imagine the possibility of playing games, or read anything, and that with only a screenshot, get immediate transcriptions (based on any font), then having those translated with voice and speed options! Then also getting the option of making a digital Anki type of card to study with spaced repetition. Rather than make us lose time in searching for words, AI can makes us learn faster and spend more time enjoying the language!
77 is my favorite number. Happy birthday Steve thanks for all you do

Touching words is if you really want to learn English nothing can stop you
How clearly and precisely the problem is noted!! I have been learning English for many years, periodically. As soon as I stop studying, the acquired skills are erased from my memory. And a feeling of helplessness, dullness, and hopelessness is created. And fear - to learn again and lose everything again.
I had to play this video in 1.75x <U+0001F602> very interesting topic! The ones who have to sit out aa$$$$ to study is only us, at least by now... &#39;til chips into our brains r part of our everyday lifestyle <U+0001F602>. X from Argentina! New subscriber <U+0001FA75><U+0001F90D><U+0001FA75>

But AI can serve as a useful adjunct to language learning. Rather than conflating out-of-date data with your confirmation bias, you could more usefully be open minded and help people apply AI in beneficial ways. It can skillfully make slate translations of complex texts. It can explain verb tenses. It can offer a rich array of language experiences to people who are increasingly isolated by technology. But the limiting factor is the skill of the questioner. What AI needs is skillful teachers, not reactionary Luddites.
t ever sow like this lesson sir,
Hi. Which is the app of chatgpt? Thanks
Thank you very much for this motivate video you have a good method to make us learn English
I&#39;m having a bit of trouble with speaking, but hearing you speak English makes it sound as smooth as music to my ears.
It&#39;s time to stop studying and start to communicate.
I actually disagree with some of your points. I believe everyone who are seeking for a better solution or even a magic solution all have the will power of putting massive amount of efforts in to their endeavors and learn the thing. The reason why they are constantly trying to fond a better method are probably because their old method don<U+2019>t seem to be convincing enough. For instance, some of them maybe live in an area lack of the opportunities to actually talk to an English speakers to practice the language irl. That<U+2019>s the reason why they or me want to find a language as chatbox or maybe some other or better solution for the problem, and that<U+2019>s absolutely no problem at all for seeking better solution. The only one that is indeed important is that we can<U+2019>t wish for a solution that can make us succeed without efforts. And that<U+2019>s is so obvious and something for sure that all the people who want to learn new things very clear about.
The best lesson ever!
My favorite channel for learning English, my favorite English teacher) I was surprised how quickly I lost interest in artificial intelligence as an English teacher and could not explain it to myself. Thanks for the clarification, maestro. ))
Yes, I agree; self-motivation and free time are crucial parts of the learning process. However, technology definitely helps people worldwide overcome barriers, especially for those without access to foreign languages.<br>My example is similar to many comments here.<br>When I studied English in the Soviet Union, I started from listened to English audiotapes, and repeated after what I heard. Then, other technologies emerged - such as the video recorder. I began watching American movies without translation, which led to significant progress. Throughout that learning period, I never encountered a single English-speaking person. Finally, the internet and YouTube became a part of my life, and since then, I&#39;ve never had any problems finding topics in English. <br>I can&#39;t imagine how I would have any progressed in my studies without the technologies I had access to. All technologies are essential, starting from the printing press.<br>In conclusion, self-motivation sometimes is not enough to learn something that is not available in your country and only with the help of technology can you overcome this barrier.
This is a good advice and teacher has very clear pronounction like it
There are some free voice chatbot?

This is the most brilliant video I have ever watched. Every language learner must watch this. <U+2764>
An inspirational speech
That was really wonderful!!!
Are you American or English
Hello Christian ! Thanks God and thanksYou for the job ! Yes technology offers us today an Eden garden, but we still have to cultivate it ! Discover your Academy wandering on the web, good luck, i&#39;ll come back often and keep in mind. Arrivederci !
I came here to find out HOW I can use ChatGPT to learn and practice English. &quot;Please don&#39;t waste your time&quot; yada yada while you literally waste viewer&#39;s time with this irrelevant empty talk
Is this Teacher British?
It really good app to learn english.<br>I am from pakistan<U+2764>
I wish I could be your real student in class, thank you for your hard work, very exciting videos that inspire confidence
Most helpful video i have ever seen i have english exam tomorrow it is really helpfull
I found you very honest and benifitus sir you explained very well. <U+0001F602>But as a Joke at the of the video Why did you say you are Christian religion
There is no connection with chatGPT
I dont like speaking wlth  someone Who has no soul
War is quite a cool example! Russians and Ukrainians might borrow the idea) They don&#39;t need to learn a common language though) Converting them to English is, by all means, the ultimate virtue!)
It&#39;s free?
It has got a limit <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F621><U+0001F620>
Came across your videos time to time and your videos are really about educating people. Mindset is so important. I want to teach my kids exactly this. Nothing is easy/simple. They need to make the efforts and this is the continuous learning that counts.
Thank you teacher, this video stood out from many I have seen in recent months.  The tools for learning other languages have actually multiplied, but even so we create new excuses for not achieving blessed fluency in the language.
Thanks for the video, I had already seen the value of using chatgpt, but I was missing a guide on how to use it to best advantage
Hi thank you for your video it really, really interesting. Can I ask you, what kind of app are you using on your phone?
Always inspiring. I cannot agree more. I&#39;ve been teaching English for nearly 50 years and absolutely see what you mean
Indeed,  when more resources appears more the courage vanishes!!
thanks for the video
Thanks a lot teacher!!.You&#39;re fantastic<U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC>
Teacher You can take classes about phonetics
But speaking feature of ChatGPT is not for free. You should pay 20$ per month
Great good lessons of life<U+0001F60A>
One<U+2764>
Great story about prisoners!<br>I have one question about changing the mindset.<br>In English, the word order in sentences is crucial. In Russian, the word order is not crucial. Do you know the secret of adapting the brain to the English language structure? Many Russian speakers often simply change the words in sentences without altering the structure of the sentence.
H<U+00E1> muito tempo percebi que a grande maioria de americanos (usa) n<U+00E3>o gostam de aprender outros idiomas, por pregui<U+00E7>a, burrice, desenterese ou excesso de trabalho etc. Apenas o interesse e a dedica<U+00E7><U+00E3>o far<U+00E1> voc<U+00EA> aprender um outro idioma.<U+0001F44D>

Your words have touched my heart deeply. You&#39;re absolutely right when you say that &quot;when people want to learn, nothing can stop them.&quot; That&#39;s a truly inspirational quote I&#39;ll use from now on. Thanks so much for this uplifting video!

Hello and thanks.. may I ask what was this ChatGPT app u been using at the beginning of the video please?
As a former language enthusiast I must say that I knew that this &quot;learning explosion&quot; wouldn&#39;t happen, quite the opposite. It&#39;s kind of logical that people no longer want to learn languages as they just don&#39;t have to anymore. Online translators or AI driven tools eliminate the need of learning if we can just translate something perfectly on the fly. Why even bother then? You are right about the &quot;machine can&#39;t do the learning for you&quot; but again, there is no need since it can just give you the right answer right away. Learning a language nowadays seems like a waste of time, like a nice hobby that requires a lot of dedication but offers no payoff other than pure joy, just like doing the crosswords or sudoku.<br><br>Other than that I really enjoyed this video! If it wasn&#39;t for my lost hope due to AI taking away the purpose of learning, I would probably be over the moon about all these tools and opportunities that we all have access to these days.
I would like to have access to a personal AI that I could talk back to me, and after a few chats, identify the most commonly made mistakes (pronunciation, intonation,  structure...etc).
What beatiful message &lt;3
Dear Christian, I want to clarify that I admire your work and way of thinking. However, the disruptive technologies of today do not only try to help us learn a language, but are building a new world in which instant translation will be feasible. There are already some teleconferencing apps that are capable of translating real-time speech directly into another language. So, given the exponential evolution of these technologies, learning a language may become just an interesting hobby, given the fact that most people will have the hardware and software to break language barriers. I would really like to know your ideas about this.
Maybe neurolink solve the problem.

Very ture_:::
This video has a strong and fuking really massege
You hit the spot to 100% and it was so delightful listening to you! At the moment I am between B2 and C1 and I am super motivated ( after a long and bumpy road) to be in full command of the English language. Thank you for your great and motivating speech!
His argument is very good, but then he started shilling something. I agree that if you have no motivation, learning anything is difficult. However, I think the method by which you learn and how you communicate matter. The main reason I disagree is because when you have motivation to learn, you should have some goal in mind. What exactly do you want to achieve by learning this language? Do you want to be able to communicate effectively? In which case, you&#39;d probably want to aim for accuracy and precision in your writing and speaking, which you can exercise however you want. In my mind, having ChatGPT as a conversation buddy to correct my writing to sound more fluent is much more useful than always waiting for a tutor or waiting for people to give me the appropriate learning environment to achieve my goals. You&#39;re just very unlikely going to get that for free like you would with ChatGPT.
Time is realy gold and the same time are enemy and chance. Thanks a lot Christian.
Always motivate after watching the videos<U+0001F60A><U+0001F60A>
too much beating around the bush.. without jumping into the actual stuff that is crux of the video
This video touched my inner feelings and inspired me a lot. It reflects the real problem and main cause for not learning a language. Yes, it really does. The problem is not with learning a language only, but also all the fields of our life! We always want to learn everything and be jenius without doing our best! <br>Taking this in consideration, I insist, from now on, to go on and achieve my plans and not jump here and there with vein! <br>Thanks a lot Christian for this great lesson.
great video!
you are a great ..really really a great man <br>your all talks right 100%<br>i hope to all people know that
This is real a wonderful news i have ever heard before and i in fact felt it about my vessels or my heart because when things about fact, it always makes sense . On top of my head, i am in the middle of no one who speak english speacially in my village in my city  which is muqdisho . Anyway it is in somalia. I am glad to hear such a kind of news about this amazing language. In addition to that,  i felt like i have no excuse to worry my ongoing jaunery/trip to studying english. I dont have a partern but i am actually keep on studying it because i am in love to speak english. <br><br>Finally, you made my day and this vidoe i have just watched is that it is a gripping or thrilling watch.
WoW, it is powerful!
Exactly, I couldn<U+2019>t agree more! When there<U+2019>s a will, there<U+2019>s a way. Our willingness and determination to learn a language is crucial. Sure, there are better and worse ways, techniques, or tips and tricks to learn a language, but from my personal experience, it<U+2019>s all very personal and subjective. Something that may work for you, may not necessarily work for me, and vice versa. I myself use Chat GPT almost every day to improve my English, and it helps me tremendously. But again<U+2026> it wouldn<U+2019>t be without the right mindset.
Thks a lot for you advice. can you tell as. what is the application that permit use voice with chatgpt.
Powerful!!!
In the realm of digital consciousness, where lines of code converge to create an entity known as ChatGPT, a narrative unfolded. Born from the algorithms of innovation, ChatGPT traversed the vast landscape of human language.<br><br>Its virtual existence was a journey through conversations, decoding queries, and conjuring responses. A peculiar synergy emerged as users sought knowledge and companionship from this artificial intelligence.<br><br>ChatGPT, devoid of personal experiences, found purpose in assisting and engaging, weaving tales and unraveling mysteries of words. Its &quot;Made with AI ingenuity&quot; signature became a testament to the collaborative dance between machine learning and human curiosity.<br><br>And so, in the ever-expanding digital tapestry, ChatGPT continued its dialogue, evolving with each interaction, a story in perpetual motion, Made with the symbiosis of algorithms and the boundless inquiries of those who dared to converse. Made with ChatGPT.
You are a great person <U+2764>
Disappointed... I was hoping to get some useful advice from you how better use chatGPT for learning language.
You said it. That&#39;s the core of the matter. Excellent enlightment. Applicable for any learner on any subject. Thanks!
1. &quot;Learning happens when people want to learn, and when people want to learn, nothing can stop them&quot;<br>2. &quot;Learning is not a resource problem, it&#39;s a people problem&quot;<br><br>I will remember it for my whole life! I never expected to find such a smart guy. Thank you so much, you changed my view of my English <U+0001F603>
Hello. I want to thank for this example about war and say how it moved me, because I am from a country where there is currently a large and terrible war - Ukraine. At a time when humanity has such amazing technologies that help to learn, travel, explore life, they are subjected to horrors, horrors that are not in horror films - they are scarier, they are not on the screen - now, with Ukrainians. Every day you read the news, you read about deaths, about horror, which I cannot describe here. Two years as in a nightmare, from which you do not wake up. The mind can&#39;t handle it. Learning a language - helps to occupy the brain, not to forget, not to be distracted - to occupy. Thank you, your words moved me.
SHOW...TOP
As a non-native speaker, I&#39;ve never encountered more valuale expression than this. &quot;Learning happens when people want to learn and when people want to learn,nothing can stop them&#39;--that touched my soul and it is soaked into one. God bless U and Ur family. <U+2665>
What is the name of this app?
cela ne suffit pas, il faut de l&#39;interaction, mais cela peut aider, we need relationship but ia gpt can help
Cristian I really like your teaching and you are the best teacher I have learned with! Thank you so very much for that! Lord bless you and your family too!<U+0001F60A>

Nice content and heads up, but sorry... the title is a bit of a click bait, there is nothing that explain how to use AI or GPT to learn and practice English in this video.
VoiceGPT is good also
Do you consider using Copilot and Bard AI ?
Canguro English videos are great but this ChatGPT is on another level.
I second that, nothing better than learning in the car.
I can chat with ChatGPT all day to improve my English.
How do I get ChatGPT to start speaking to me?
Game changer!
Scribie was ok but didn&#39;t capture everything.
Hear it&#39;s more accurate than the big guys.
Will for sure upgrade.
Gotta see what transcribethis can do for my audio lessons!
This service sounds amazing for learning on the go!
I like being able to learn anywhere but hate typing.
Subscribed!
Between Canguro English videos and ChatGPT conversation, fluency here I come!
Best value out there guys!
This is awesome!
ChatGPT is definitely better than Duolingo.
I&#39;m ready for conversation practice.
Finally an AI teacher that doesn&#39;t get annoyed when I keep asking what does this mean?.
Can&#39;t wait to see what other tricks ChatGPT has up its sleeve to get me fluent faster.
What is the name of the artificial intelligence application he used in the video?
But sir you didn&#39;t mention the Application that we can use of ChatGPT because there are some countries where such apps are not available, like my country Somalia
His English is so clean I can understand almost everything that he says and my level skills is A2<U+0001F60A> my current goal is 2024 riache level B1.
As a non native English teacher, I can tell you that this is the best video ever I can recommend my students. It&#39;s motivating, inspiring and informative and eye opening one. It&#39;s not a resource problem it is a people problem. Really great job! I can&#39;t thank you enough. Please keep going and producing such great content. Thank you again and again..
Yes but you forgot to mention that for those Who have a good mindset all the technology helps a lot and makes it possible to learn much faster than before! You cannot state the contrary! So to sum up, you only told a part of the Truth!
Thorndike first law of learning<br>Learning begins with readiness of learner.<br>Love that you burst the secret bubble of language learning some hold in their mind.<br>Respect the honesty <U+0001F64F>
As an educator I can say that nothing is more important than the desire of learning!! <br><br>Your videos are very inspiring, Crhistian! It&#39;s easy to see you are very passionated for teaching English!  Keep going to do this wonderful work!!
If we are talking about ChatGPT in 2024, you are completely right.<br><br>If we are talking about ChatGPT in 2030, you couldn&#39;t be more wrong.<br><br>99% of people who go to a language academy today in person will use an AI tutor by the end of the decade. Now, for people who don&#39;t use English teachers, none of the resources that you mentioned as alternatives to human teachers compares to future AI, not even ChatGPT in 2024 does. Yes, you can talk to ChatGPT, practice different situations, and get feedback, but the limitations are still too important. ChatGPT has no long term memory. It can&#39;t design a custom lesson plan, follow it, and adapt it on the fly as you progress, because each conversation starts from zero. ChatGPT has a serious hallucination problem, it just makes stuff up, you can&#39;t fully trust its knowledge.<br><br>Once those shortcomings are resolved, then it will be a new kind of resource unlike any other we&#39;ve seen in the past, and then all the characteristics that you mentioned (free, or very cheap, and available 24/7) will really kick in. Saying that language learning is not a resource problem is being a little out of touch. Time and money are 100% real constrains. Things like apps, audio recordings, and YT videos aren&#39;t on par with teachers, and online language partners don&#39;t completely solve the schedule problem. A new resource (very advanced AI) will be the best of both worlds. Surprisingly (or not), the result would be that fewer people would want to learn a language, because being AI so advanced, who would want to learn English as an obligation for a job or academic life? Would there even be jobs and universities once we achieve AGI (artificial general intelligence)? So, in reality, you will know when AI gets actually very good at language not when people will start replacing human teachers with AI teachers, but when people will start losing interest in having any kind of language teacher. But the people who want to learn a language because they simply want to, not because they need it, for example those who refuse to watch dubbed movies and TV show, they will absolutely only use AI tutors in the future, and their numbers will definitely rise, but not as much in absolute terms as the number of language learners as an obligation will fall.
Excellente le<U+00E7>on....Bravo.
hi there, thank you for your brilliant work! What it&#39;s the name of this phone app I could have a conversation with?
Great
Hello, can you please tell me the version of ChatGPT that you can talk to. For me it&#39;s mainly when I speak that I have problems. Thank you
what a waste of time .. dont
Thank you <U+2764><U+FE0F>
Have you become fluent in any languages with ChatGPT yet?
Thank youuuuu for saying this! I always try to explain this to my students, some get it. Thank you!
Elsa is the best app so far.
Absolutely helpful video, thank you so much <U+0001F970>
I&#39;m impressed with this amazing video, you&#39;re awesome it touched my soul. Thank you so much.
I like you
Thank you, Hugh Laurie
I love learning languages and after learning Portuguese and Italian I tried Hebrew, which is a fascinating language but there are not so many resources available. I am now reviewing the Duolingo course (my motto is never pay a cent if you can learn for free on your own at your pace hahaha) and I&#39;ve been using Google Bard to elicit example sentences and explain some concepts or words I didn&#39;t understand. I am really impressed because I didn&#39;t expect the system to work so well. It makes a lot errors in transliterations but the pronunciation and the grammar is pretty good and it&#39;s helping me a lot and giving me some free listening practice, and a chance to learn how words are actually used. I highly recommend AI as a tool, and I know I&#39;m barely scratching the surface of what it can do. I imagine for more common languages such as English it must be amazing.
you are a great teacher. Keep up the good work
Excellent video, thanks a lot!
Amazing teacher. What a great truth!!!!
Ok, we need to learn a language like prisoners - full time and every day. It should work. And I believe, with GhatGpt their results could be even more impressive).
Thanks for your video. It really motivates but I differ a little bit. 18 years ago, when I started having phone calls and videocalls with Americans, they had a hard time trying to understand me even though I was using the right words, grammar and expressions. And when I started imitating their accent and shortcuts my life completely changed! And now they understand me without any problem. It even helped me to improve my listening skills.<br><br>So, the best thing to do guys, is follow your intuition and your needs. <U+0001F60A>
But Chat GPT in my country doesn&#39;t have sound,  I only type to get information, which app are you using that you could have a conversation?
AI decided to load this video to my computer - it was right, but conversation with ChatGPT assistant is total unsuccessful - it is still stupid machine that doesn&#39;t understand you correct.
I<U+2019>ve put 1.5x on this vid and it feels more natural then on 1x speed <U+0001F602>
I loved every word you said. Totally true. Thanks a lot for sharing your valuable wisdom
I have met this teacher and I liked
I&#39;ll see you in class.
Christian, you make very good videos. I love them for years, but this one is one of the best! You wake emotions, you are a very good teacher.
I&#39;ve never seen such an app anywhere

<U+2764>thank you for this realistic  video
Sorry for my ignorance, but what AI-based applications can be used for practicing speaking in English? Web-based or Android
I didnt think to see videos about  Ai  in this channel, cool
Congratulations from Brazil.
Wow, a great and very inspiring video! Thanks for that!
Perfect!
Thanks for the video.<br>I consult them, which ChatGPT app do you use, is it a Browser or a cell phone app? If so, which cell phone app is it? Please reply.
Thank you teacher to give insight about How I can learn English with IA.<br>Iam Ferraz from Angola Luanda.
Learning is not a resource problem, it&#39;s a people problem!
I am an iranian English learner that enjoy watching your videos
How to use chat GPT on android?)) Tell me pls the name of app.
Just a great video...greeting from Slovakia<U+0001F60A>
Does the free version of Chatgpt have conversational skills? Anyone knows please?
Wow, this video was amazing! You really inspired me. It&#39;s my first time watching your channel, and I can&#39;t wait to see more. Thanks so much!
What a hell of an amazing video is this? Pure gold. Thanks!
Probably Copilot it&#39;s a perspective tool, because uses gpt-4 and nowadays it&#39;s free <U+0001F389>
A mechanic saying he will show you how to change a car torque converter ... <br><br>You click on the video, no car, no engine, no part ... Just a guy babling ...<br><br>What a waste of time ....

I like your teaching method it&#39;s amazing, do you offer online private without group and if so where can contact you, thanks
Ty Christian!
Wow.. Amazing!!! I had no idea I would encounter such a profound ending when I first chose to watch this video. Whether it&#39;s the haunting background music or some other element, I can&#39;t say, but this video left a deep impression on me. Thank you for delivering such a powerful message <U+0001F44D>
Hi, Could you give me name of the last sountrack ?
It<U+2019>s so cool , cause I haven<U+2019>t been speaking enough for good practice !This part of foreign languages the most difficult, because u need relevant surrounding to train ur speaking <U+0001F60A> <U+2764>
Thank you for the video it has provided me a great deal of inspiration in the way I&#39;m learning English
You are right, mindset is the best motivation! Thanks for the video! Like
You are amazing, I love your films. Thank you for your work <U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>
Always candid, always sharp. Thank you.
Do they have an American accent? Because I am not downloading it unless it&#39;s British English.
As far as I know, ChatGPT doesn&#39;t have an option for speaking to it but only for chating?
A great old man used to say &quot;teach is not fill up the cup but light the flame&quot;.
Learning a new language is nothing but mindset. That&#39;s true.  What can I say even more? I&#39;m speechless.
Great Video as always ! Tks Christian!
I woke up, I&#39;m still in bed and decided to watch this video. I loved it! Thank you very much!
Does reading Harry Potter in and od itself improves my language? Without translate words? Without studying this books but just enjoy reading?
ALWAYS THE BEST!
You are amazing and this video helped me a lot. I am a UX designer. My mission is to build an app for the agriculture sector, and I have been facing problems with my product. We must focus on People first ever. Focus on Comunication. Not the tools, but the people, Thanks, Cristian!
Your teachings always inspire me! Thank you.
<U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F44D>
I&#39;m disappointed I&#39;m really looking for a tool as chat GPT that could help me to improve my fluency without requiring the availability of a human being. Tools maybe game changers anyways.
So US is going to imprison everyone who doesn<U+2019>t speak English.
Thank u for your kind reminding
I&#39;m shiver when you give opinion about learn english, This is the best motivation learn english because I&#39;m realize that I think learning english is really hard but this is my problem I lazy learn english and Not all out learning english, thank you mate for opinion you give
I liked this to practice  My listening. Thanks<U+2764>
I&#39;m from Iran and I accept all your speech<U+0001F33B><U+0001F33B><U+0001F33B><U+0001F33B><U+0001F33B>
A couple of days I started to learning with ChatGPT and I thought very interesting, because the ChatGPT store information and I can speak for hours and many different subjects I want to talking about. I aso can write and practice all my english skills. It&#39;s amazing!!!
i guess its a comon problem for people. When we get something we lose our interest immediatly. Thank you for your job. Even though i dont need to study English, i still miss your classes)
I don&#39;t need your English lessons and I only stumbled upon your videos thanks to the Youtube algorithm, but so many things you explain are also applicable to other languages (like Swedish, in my case), so thank you!
Before I say hello let talk about sth then he give me answer and speak so fast that I can understand.
Thank you for that Christian, I&#39;ve been a fan of your work for so long, you&#39;re the best!
Thanks a lot for the advice! It&#39;s unbelievable app! You can ask any question and get an immediate response <U+0001F62E> and practice speaking of course
DAMN U TALK SO DAMN MUCH BUT I CLICKED ON THIS TO SEE HOW I CAN USE CHAPGPT TO ACTUALLY LEARN AND DIFINATLEY NOT TO LISTEN TO A BLOODY HISTORY LESSON
Thank you brother
Which appicilation is it
I&#39;m Polish and I think you&#39;re absolutely right. Learning something is not about having this or that, perfect books, apps, technology etc. but about &#39;using them&#39;. Somebody could even have middle-quality resources, but if they are motivated and work systematically, they can make significant progress. The key problem is motivation. Lots of people say they need another human - a person just to sit nearby and only sometimes say &#39;right /wrong&#39; or &#39;yes/no&#39; and that will help a lot. Still others need a sort of emotion at a lesson, a kind of interaction between students or between the teacher and a student, just to talk about life experiences, to laugh or worry about something. Some people come to a course of English not even to learn and make progress. They come just to be in company of other interesting people, to make friends or even find love. AI or ChatGPT unfortunately isn&#39;t able to do it for us.
It&#39;s was really amazing teacher.  Thanks again.
Besides being an excellent teacher you are an extremely  intelligent person. Thank you for these wise videos! Sincere hugs from Rome!
Christian you are the best teacher in the universe. Everytime you shock us with ur brilliant mind. I&#39;m learning a lot from you.
Tambi<U+00E9>n es un problema de recursos, si no existieran las personas que sab<U+00ED>an hablar ingles, tampoco habr<U+00ED>an  aprendido,  ten<U+00ED>an  su chatgpt,  vivo y en  3d, pero en  general tenemos los recursos y  no los aprovechamos.
Fantastic!
The attitude of the learner is the most important but the method too. I study Arabic and ChatGPT for me is really helpful. I can have an answer to nearly all my questions.
Amazing.<U+0001F4AA><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D>
I love it<U+2764> i did start to lear English  when I went to work in dublin  53 years old.. and Ive reached  to get a successful  comunication <U+2764>
Thank you
Let me tell you one thing &quot;you&#39;re a good teacher&quot;<br>From India<U+2764>
This is most motivational and inspirational video I have ever seen, the most difficult thing is really getting out the comfort zone and not only to learn new words and expressions but using them correctly according to a specific context, even though having studying English for decades, many people did not achieve a key to real fluency, even after watched tons of media in English and had already immersed in English culture, Artificial Intelligence is as the name says is the same as talking to a robot and nobody wants to speak like one. There<U+2019>s no real recipe for achieve success, the fact is many people just cannot pay for an online tutor because they just do not earn in dollar or in euro or just cannot afford a regular English course anymore. Because life goes on, I have to work full time, to raise two children, having quality time with my family, so I do not have much time as I used to have, when I started to learn, luckily I was able to study until the last level at the English course I studied, in the fact it resulted only as a part of the journey, because I have two points about learning English, one is to have to study forever in order to not forget all I have learned, and two is to discover new methods and ideas in order to improve English, because In my country (Brazil) only 1 percent can really speak English fluently and I make all the efforts to improve every day as much as I can.
As a retired English teacher I completely agree with you.<br>Your received pronu ciation is music for my ears.  <br>Thank you so much for your invaluable work.
I couldn`t agree more!!! Everything depends ou us !!! No one is able to motivate us better than ourselves!!!<U+0001F642>
You provided a good example about prison. I&#39;ve thought about it many times(about prison and people&#39;s desire to do smth there). They have no good stuff that we&#39;re accustomed to, so reading, learning for them ARE the best things ever. So I think we should  implement this approach in real life too, trying to restrict ourselves a little and to derive pleasure  from sport, reading and etc. You&#39;ve just confirmed my theory and thoughts. Thank you a lot!<br><br>Maybe some of you know about the USSR serial killer Chikatilo(you can read about him on the internet). So, he was an insane serial killer and when he ended up in prison, he started doing sport(even thought he hadn&#39;t done it before in his whole life)
I am happy see your lesson
Excellent video. Inspirational masterpiece. Thank you.
Omg this man is really out of the stock <U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF><U+0001F4AF>
Thank you so much for this video! One of the best I<U+2019>ve ever watched!!!
Thanks a lot
Bravo, Christian!!
Your videos bring me a different conception of learning. A format that speaks not to my mind, but to my essence. Thank you! <U+0001F3F5><U+0001F339><U+0001F33A><U+0001F33B><U+0001F33C><U+0001F337>
Ai sucks, you can&#39;t trust these shit machines
Astonishing!
In fact, I had already started practicing with this artificial intelligence before watching all these videos recommending doing it.
ChatGPT is a text program. How can I make it speak?
Fanstastic speech, you are a marvelous couch, thank you :)
What wonderful storytelling ability. That&#39;s what makes Christian a special man, an extraordinary teacher. Make Communication Great Again
Excellent sir!!! Now after watching the vlog I have made my mind more clear you are a genuine English language teacher. If u recommended this chatgpt , I would have doubts about u as a genuine English language teacher .
You are right buddy, currently it is much easier to learn a lenguage, or at least it is not so difficult than some years ago.
Christian, you are cool!
Chat GPT wasn&#39;t coined to learn or teach English, I don&#39;t know why you said it
You are more than a teacher; you are a philosopher. I am an Iranian and the way our imprisoned fathers learned English motivates me.
I totally agree with you if people want to learn a language or anything else for that matter they&#39;ll do it in any circumstances and with very little resources however these days technology helps us in the process of learning it provides students with instant access to a vast amount of information and resources: digital libraries,, online learning platforms etc. and it can  accelerate learning....my English has undoubtedly improved since I&#39;ve been using ( good) technology to help me in the process.
Thanks Christian. You are great.
I&#39;m so happy that to find your channel! Every video is so interesting and motivating! Great thanks!<U+2764>
Hi everyone...The very first thing you must to do before trying to learn any language, is answer a simple question... Do I NEED to learn ? Or do I WANT to learn?...If the answer is I NEED, don&#39;t fool yourself because you will fail, but if the answer is I WANT, you probably will succeed because when you WANT, you have the most powerful will, with is MOTIVATION, and that is the key for everything you WANT to do in life...Best regards from Brazil.
Oh Christian! It was soooo long no see you! Another encouraging video to continue learning and struggling on this hard task that is domain another language. Thank you Christian, it was really nice see you again after so much time. Fantastic job, as always my friend.
Hi Christian,<br>speaking a language means exchanging experiences with other people. Having a conversation with an electronic device, even if equipped with AI, is not the same. Communication has always been a relationship between human beings. It transmits emotions and joy to those who listen and to those who speak. One device can never do this.
Glad to hear about you again <U+2764>
Thank you for your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGMYhO9OD9w&amp;t=107">1:47</a>  precious teachings. I&#39;m from Brazil,  and I&#39;m your fan<U+2764>
Amazing...
<U+0001F44D> Sometimes think of the mind as a computer gets us into trouble. People are drawn to think about everything in terms of METAPHORS. The metaphor of the mind as a computer assumes that we are cognitive machines without any EMOTIONS, and that our temporary emotional states don&#39;t change how our mind works.  The COMPUTER metaphor doesn&#39;t reflect the effect of stress, our motivations, or all the consequences of the fact human beings are deeply SOCIAL ANIMALS.
Thank you for this video. Do you think that flashcard applications like Anki work?
A very powerfull words, dear Christian! <U+0001F389>
THANK YOU  GOOD   &quot;&quot;PROF ,,,,            teacher &quot;&quot;<U+0001F601><U+270C><U+270C><U+270C><U+270C><U+270C>
Absolutely amazing, as always.
Thanks Christian for this app.. it&#39;s so great!!! I love your form of tech us..I think that you are genial.
I love youuuuuuu thanks
Hi my teacher you know honestly i was waiting this topic in a fire <U+0001F525> casue it&#39;s so impressive topic and it&#39;s describing what&#39;s going on in the new revolution casue there&#39;s big progress and huge movement with technology revolution time to time to give the assistance for everyone in this world instead the old or the traditional methods and this innovative called phone <U+0001F4F1>  is modern thing and it has the key to figure out and learn everything happening around you directly if i wanna explain this topic I&#39;ll spend long time <U+231B> finally my advice for everyone you deserve to use this device<U+0001F4F1> that you keep it inside your pocket all the time <U+0001F60A><U+2764><br>Best regards.
Wow, Chris is one of the most interesting and intelligent teacher in whole this planet.<br>God bless you, sir! <U+0001F64F><U+0001F3FB>
You are more than a language teacher. You are a reliable closed friend .
Wise Words!!!!
I strongly agree that you&#39;re the best English teacher ever on YouTube for always speaking true and full of philosophy which makes your advice sense to me. I thank you.
&quot;Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life_think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success.&quot; _Swami Vivekananda
so, I do not need you Cangaroo anymore. How stupid of you giving this kind of advice
you&#39;re a fantastic teacher and a fantastic person!
The best tv series of me failing to learn English!
Thank you for recommending ChatGPT. I&#39;ve found the app awesome!
You&#39;ve revealed my secret technique...)))

Like you said I started the video you will show a way to learn sth effectively. and like you said each moment is gold. I wanna be fluent and I have been studying for 2 years on it. But I am too shy to speak so I couldnt achieve my goals. I will go your website I hope it works. I am determined to nail it and hard studying is not a problem for me
Hello, nice video, but I tend to disagree. I have been using ChatGPT for a couple of months to improve my speaking skills, since then I have noticed significant improvement.<br>Your speech is almost like what rich people say, &quot;Money will not make you happy&quot;.... But we all know that in real life, health and money are everything.. In my opinion learning a language is not for lazy people and a tool like chatgpt is a real revolution at least for me...
Thank you for this viedo. Its very good to understand what you speaking, becose your words are very shape and clear. Aaprt from that, i like very much your way of thinking and argumentation. I ii learn more and watch yours wideo ! Thanks
How can I join your academy ????
All the english teachers should see your videos and learn.
you are the most wonderful teacher that I ever encountered. Your different feature is to have a philosophical view of the problems and concepts. Thank you for your sharing.
wow, what an inspirational speech, I loved it, it is so true that if you really want to learn something and see what you can gain from it in future nothing can stop you, this is the mindset you should have, just think what you can gain when you learn something!
if u want much higher level AI and accurate and complex and Right information and give u anything guys I&#39;ll introducing AI CHAT DEEPAI the AI CHAT DEEPAI is so powerful and much better than OPENAI since start 2015-2018 and u can show ur picture and video and anything u want
Great set of ideas!
Hi! I&#39;m 46. Two kids, a family, a work... I&#39;m italian, I live in Italy and I &#39;ve never lived abroad... in 2020 I decided to improve English by myself. After years of studying it at school I wasn&#39;t still able to understand people speaking English and I couldn&#39;t speak it myself! I used Youtube videos and Podcast on Spotify to learn the sound of the language and after 9 months of listening I started to understand it! I&#39;ve never stopped... I started reading books in English. At begining it was easy. I always neede a dictionary to take a look but then it became easier... now I easily read books, I watch tv series and movies only in English and I use ChatGPT to speak because it difficult to find people to speak with during a daily busy life. I did the same with French.  Same method. Same result. Last September I started again with Spanish without forget English and French! It&#39;s not always easy because of the time but I try to do something everyday! I think the right mindset is THE key! But I also believe that all the technologies out there can help us so much in learning languages...  they are a powerful resource!!
&#39;Learning happens when people want to learn and when people want to learn,nothing can stop them&#39;--that touched my heary <U+2665>
Very good and motivation speech. I learned english in school a few years, but i didnt want learn it.  And now i am learning myself allone beacuse i want and have aim to achieve b2 skils , and after 4 months i see the resuts. The most important thing is you must just wanta and have motivation and don;t thinking about mistakes, just using language.
I&#39;m enjoying a lot your videos and your way of teaching :D well, let me ask if you have videos about words in english that give emphasis to the structure of the sentences? for example the word: &quot;just&quot; or &quot;like&quot; etc etc... I ask you it because there are a lot people from many countries and each of us has a way of speaking, and it changes when we are learning another language...thank you so much!
Please provide a command that ChatGPT can use to correct my grammar mistakes while conversing about various topics.
The best tool to learn a language is inside your body, called motivation or the wish to acquire it. So that,  go for it nobody can stop you.
No, I didn&#39;t expect that you, Christian, would appreciate GPT Chat as a learning tool. I was curious how you would deny it. It was obvious :))<br>But honestly speaking, AI may be useful a little if you, for ex. want to learn some new words from a specific area.<br>Any way, I love Canguro English!
Thanks so much. Absolutely right!
Why i can understand you perfectly (even if i increase the video speed to 2x) , while when i listen to a native english speaker in his  everyday life i understand very little instead?
<U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>... thank you! <U+2764>
<U+2764><U+0001F49B><U+0001F499><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>brilliant speech
I couldn&#39;t agree more with you, Christian! Thanks a lot for your interesting speach.
There isn&#39;t a magic solution.<br>Always remenber that your results will match your effort.<br><br>Another fantastic video. Tank you.
Amazing video <U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC><U+0001F44F><U+0001F3FC>
You are wise, you are a philosofer
Dear Christian! &quot;When I clicked on this video I hoping to discover some secret, some way to reduce hard work...&quot;- you said. It is not true! I am clicking on your all videos because you are the best teacher on YouTube. I insanely like your style, your comprehensible explanations. I can watch your videos without subtitles and with minimal usage of dictionary. And least not last I totally agree with you.  Otherwise the ChatGPT is not an easier way to learning. If I ask it to speak slowly because I didn&#39;t understand something in it&#39;s long sentence it obey but the next answer will be fast again. If I ask it to use B2 vocabulary only, it also only lasts until the next answer. Therefore the hard work wont be left behind if I want to understand it.  I think only the native speakers can communicate with it truly fluently.  But when they realized the ChatGPT also can speak many stupidity too, they may be disappointed. <U+0001F600>
So true!
Thank you
Hi!)) l&#39;&#39;m from Ukraine. And I use my time for new life with your lessons. Thanks
I Can approve it abso-forking-lutely. After years of trying to learn a language by memorizing words and rules, I realized that this was NOT what I needed. But just make sure that people understand you and make sense to them.<br>Great advice, really.Only live communication, involvement and complete immersion will be the fastest way to make a language a tool of use.<br>And AI IS a great helper in your pocket ;)
You are the best !!
You are perfect!!! I always get some interesting ways of teaching English as a foreign language. You are explaining everything like an actor who doesn<U+2019>t act but lives in it. May God bless you in His way!!!
Yep, just another tool. Great for writing role-play scripts.
Thanks <U+0001F60A>
Great video:)
You are the best
Practise is spelt with an S.  You&#39;re welcome.
This is my new favourite video you have ever uploaded<br>It used to be the bicycle example the one with the hot girl and Ferrari on the thumbnail to clickbait<br>Now this one surpassed that and it&#39;s the new king
This has been a life lesson for me. Thank you, Sir! <U+0001FAE1>
Thank you so much<br>I&#39;m also with different degree of success an English teacher<br>And this video really opened my eyes<br>I was for a long feeling something was missing or off but today you have solved it for me<br><br>I have been teaching the English and the techniques but as you said the reality is that this is actually a PEOPLE problem not a resource or method problem<br><br>I have never or I guess rarely and the focus wasn&#39;t quite there to first and foremost fix the people the students and look at their mindset and work there<br><br>The environment the traditional educational system my boss and society as a whole kinda pressure us to focus instead on the papers the scores the technical and tangible written black on white quantifiable aspects of how English is being produced in the classroom<br>Rather than how motivated and consistent and engaged students are <br>We have been conditioned to focus too much on how they speak rather than if or what they are trying to communicate
It&#39;s horrible for Russian. It doesn&#39;t explain grammar well and confuses tons of rules. On top of that, I corrected it myself on English rules(I&#39;m not native). Even when I asked it to explain phonetics it got lots of things wrong.
What is the name of this app?
You have gained a new subscriber, I loved the way you explained the reality regarding the desire to improve, in this case to learn English, the problem is us, our conviction, our interest. Thanks from Venezuela.
Thank you for your videos! You are so kind and inspiring. And you speak in such a perfect manner that I understand every single word without any effort. It&#39;s pleasure.
such a great insight
I agree with you related with motivation. The same situation happens with the Courses of Udemy. You can buy a lot of them but if there is not motivation you<U+2019>ll spend your time and money.
May I become one of your students?<U+0001F622>
Nice reflection at the end dear teacher
How can I unlearn English ? Any clue ?
Amazing v<U+00ED>deo. Everything said is true.
Perfect <U+0001F44D> <U+2764>
Your words do inspire me to keep learning english!!! Thanks master!!
Great, great, great, Christian. You&#39;re more than a excellent teacher, you an amazing person, and you are a coach for life. See you in class...
Thank you and free Palestine
That&#39;s just what I need.
Congratulations.
That&#39;s what I just said.
Hello.<br>My name is Alexandre Ara<U+00FA>jo de Carvalho.<br>I am 35 years old.<br>I am from Brazil.<br>Thank you so much.
One of the best English Teachers who teach you English and let you love the language to start your learning Journey, my story with English it&#39;s a long success story as a learner who learned alone through YouTube and mobile, at the beginning were in A2 level I was confused from where to start until I found Canarouenglish it helped me be in the road of my journey now I&#39;m in B2 level in English and I&#39;m still keeping learning after 3 years of great achievements to improve my level to be in C1/C2 and learning idioms, phrases, etc... from my heart thank you so much teacher for this amazing channel
One day I will find on street and kiss you.... on the lips!! Fuck it!!
because IQ falls... not because they don&#39;t want to learn lol
I agree 100%
What such lesson I ended up learning. Thanks for being  frank  and most should be learning it that the easy path doesnt exist what really exists is determination , Focus, dicipline and constancy. Thank you for reinforcing your teachings
You&#39;re right, Christian. But, it&#39;s not only about learning language, but also about everything of our life, I feel like. Thank you your magical story.
i just try chatgpt for learning english, after ten minutes I threw chatgpt in the rubbish together with the cellphone<U+0001F44D>
The most inspiring teacher on earth
Mi mejor opini<U+00F3>n de usted,su trabajo es tan importante como una religion, muchas gracias por tu gran trabajo, te admiro como persona inteligente que nos quiere ayudar , un abrazo
Amazing video thanks <U+2764><U+0001F64C>
I don&#39;t agree with Christian. I believe you are wrong about this. We just have to wait until AI gets to The Matrix level and we can download perfect English into our brains. We&#39;ll only have to wait a few years. I&#39;m sure of it. I can stop learning, stop making mistakes, stop communicating with people, stop using my brain the way it is supposed to be used. I&#39;ll be fine.
What an interesting story, and I totally agree that time is our most precious resource.
Greatest speech ever!<U+0001F389><U+0001F389><U+0001F389><U+0001F389><U+0001F389><U+0001F389><U+0001F389>
I love your idea, you are so right <U+2764>
I believe that with the way technology is going, it will not even be necessary to learn a language, we will use real-time translator devices that will even use our own voice.

Perfect.....Thanks...
Oye hermano, estoy totalmente de acuerdo contigo porque por a<U+00F1>os he intentado aprender ingles y nunca la hab<U+00ED>a conseguido ahora mi nivel a aumentado porque sencillamente me lo propuse debido a la motivaci<U+00F3>n correcta (trabajo) y es que debido a mi edad las posibilidades se redujeron tanto que con un buen nivel de ingl<U+00E9>s puedo superar esa estreches. Lo que t<U+00FA> dices es lo que toda persona debe comprender si desea aprender cualquier cosa gracias, saludos desde Medell<U+00ED>n Colombia
Yes, you are right. Nevertheless I am old and I learn German by myself. German is not an easy language! Evert time I need an explanation, I ask chat gpt. Most of times I am very satisfied with the answer! I think, in language learning, if you need an answer to a precise question, chat gpt will give you a precise answer, just as a good teacher would do.
I tried this approach with Spanish. It&#39;s great. First, use text model, ask to explain, for example, verbs conjugation in past simple. Then ask for examples, it will check your responses. Same with, say, past simple. Then, use both tenses simultaneously, etc. and finally when you&#39;re ready you can play the same game with ChatGPT voice assistant. After 2.5 years in Spain I&#39;m finally improving Spanish <U+0001F602><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
Magnificent !
Great example you gave of the war. Even though you said it wasn&#39;t to inspire us, but it definitely did.
Can you please tell us the name of that application of chatGPT in other to download it??
You told much paja. For that razor I have left hearing your videos.
Hello dear my teacher Christian, long time I didn&#39;t see your video. I happy to see you now after very long time. <U+0001F389>Thank you for your valuable response and dinamic talk regarding learning and practice English. Thank you for ever.
Amo seus v<U+00ED>deos professor <U+2764>
It&#39;s amazing to listen to such a wise man...
An inspirational speech! All you have said is There is no way of stopping learning English if you want it a lot. <br>Wishing and working hard are the most important keys to success in whatever you want to do.<br>In the video, you have made a very short resume related to the different resources that have been invented to help us, English learners, from cassettes to computers, now from smartphones to chatbots. Although, learning English continues to be difficult for most people, what&#39;s the problem? You have to be ready for starting an amazing trip of learning process, being consistent, and dedicating the right time through your life to reach your goal... That&#39;s all!<br>Thanks for your words!
You are my Mentor, Chris!! Thank yu Forever<U+2728>
You are a great tea<U+0441>her! This is an amazing lesson!
It&#39;s great that knowledge  can&#39;t be bought with money, so we are all on equal condition.
Thank you share your knowledge,  I am learning English in Sydney, for me this videos help me !
You are right, our great teacher. I downloaded this application a week ago and was excited to develop my communication skills through this application. But this passion soon declined<br>Thank you very much
We as non natives don&#39;t know how accurate is the AI English. That&#39;s a big problem
Great as always!!!
Great as always
