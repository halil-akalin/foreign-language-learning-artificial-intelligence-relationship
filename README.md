# Examining how individuals perceive positive and negative innovations brought by artificial intelligence in foreign language learning within the scope of text mining and emoji mining
Using the R programming language, data was extracted from YouTube, tokenized, and sentiment analysis was performed. The sentiment distribution and scores resulting from the sentiment analysis were matched with the emoji set, and emoji states were extracted according to the sentiment of each word in the data set. Finally, data visualization was performed.


## Project purpose:

This project aims to investigate the use of artificial intelligence in foreign language learning, analyzing individuals' reactions through text mining and emoji analysis methods. Details of the project, including the code used and the analyses performed, are summarized below.

## Project Contents:

- **Dataset:** Data is taken from the comments of the following content on the YouTube platform:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Jwtv1rRa-A,
- **Code:** Data was pulled from YouTube via R programming language. Data was cleaned and processed using the R language. The processing stages are tokenizing the data and performing sentiment analysis. After these processes, data visualization operations were performed.
- **Results:** As a result of the findings, it was seen that 75% of the players had a positive opinion about the use of artificial intelligence in foreign language learning. 25% expressed their negative opinions verbally.

## How to Use
1. **Run the Code:** Execute the R bettiks to perform analyses. Don't forget to install the necessary dependencies.
2. **Review the Results:** Explore the results of the analyzes in pdfs in the data_processing folder.
